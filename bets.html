        <h1>How to accelerate science</h1>
        <p>
            Many have successfully identified the flaws with our scientific institutions. Some have extensively studied the causal factors behind these flaws and articulated them well in writing. Fewer still have seriously tried to fix the problems by instantiating their ideas in new institutions. None have successfully out-competed academia at scale. At this point, one must appreciate the evolutionary fitness of our existing institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact remains that academia is holding back scientific progress. We find ourselves in a prolonged period of stagnation, despite pleas that incremental progress continues to deliver new results. Stagnation is not a statement about quantity or speed, but about a lack of acceleration and of extraordinary events.
        </p>
        <p>
            To date, there is only one system which has reliably produced acceleration and extraordinary events: capitalism. So let's reframe the problem in the spirit of capitalism. If academia does such a bad job at accelerating science, why can't we make science make money and out-compete colleges?
        </p>
        <p>
            I plan to do exactly this. While I do not know the specifics of how to design this institution yet, I have made a series of well-informed bets that guide my strategy. Even if the majority of these bets are wrong or inconsequential, capitalizing on just a few of them is sufficient to beat academia.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Theoretical research will experience a "chess moment" in the next decade.</b>  The effects will be largely psychological, because research will not be immediately "solved", but researchers will be forced to adapt to an entirely new paradigm. We will see a sharp increase in: number of researchers, accessibility of knowledge, capability at the highest level, disciplinary flexibility, truth-seeking behavior. Corresponding decrease in: contributor age, experts, gatekeeping.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>The line between education and research is blurred into a single continuum.</b> Research is simply learning things no one else has learned yet. Learning looks like asking difficult questions beyond your current abilities, hypothesizing answers, frequently checking with AI, occasionally checking with experts, publishing learnings, receiving feedback. This process is the same regardless of whether you are a beginner or expert. In the presence of this continuum, fast feedback loops are more important than ever.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Transition from reductionism to hybrid connectionism in science.</b> Complex, hyper-specific, analytic models will be replaced by a combination of data-driven gray-box modelling and interpretation using general theoretical principles. This will allow us to construct theoretical models of complex systems which were previously difficult or impossible to quantitatively describe (e.g. psychology, history, economics). Boundaries between previously distinct fields will become fractally tiled by new multi-disciplinary fields, and cross-disciplinary connections will be the rule rather than the exception.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Scientific progress can only be accelerated by private funding.</b> Scientific progress is currently slowed by reliance on philanthropy; acceleration requires stronger feedback loops. To maintain any hope of sustainable scientific progress, research institutions must be funded by a source strongly coupled to the quality of their output. Few individuals must be able to make outsized returns for great discoveries/inventions, and identifying those individuals early must be financially incentivized.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Talent density has intrinsic value, implying potential capital value.</b> In a world of fattening power law tails, exceptional individuals are valued higher relative to the median. Tech companies and investors will pay more for access to exceptional individuals and people will invest more heavily in themselves (and their children) for the chance to become one. This money will be distributed to institutions proportionally to the density of talent they manage to attract.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            <b>Effective nerdsniping can beat venture capitalists at identifying talent.</b> Nothing attracts talented people like an interesting problem and someone to talk about it with.
