        <h2>Research Philosophy</h2>

        <p><b>Q</b>: If you're trying to understand life, why aren't you researching biology or chemistry?</p>
        <p>
            <b>A</b>: Imagine you're a young grad student in the 90s hoping to contribute to our understanding of intelligence.
            Would you choose to study neuroscience given what we know today? It seems obvious that you would have
            learned a lot more about intelligence by learning to code and studying AI!
        </p>
        <p>
            That's why I believe that the best way to answer <i>What is Life?</i> is to learn to code and simulate
            digital creatures all day. Programming lets you run tens or hundreds of experiments a day, while in a wet lab
            it takes on the order of days or even weeks to run a single experiment. Plus, I already learned how to code 
            during my time researching AI and building a startup.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p><b>Q</b>: How do you choose what to work on? </p>
        <p>
            <b>A</b>: I treat research as an extension of learning. I just do what I did in high school to learn math, but
            now I'm learning things nobody knows about yet. Honestly, the hardest part is distinguishing between what's already
            well known, what's known but not well understood, and what's an open problem. When learning you can assume everything
            is well known, but research is a lot more complicated (e.g. what is entropy?).
        </p>

        <p>
            When I saw ALife simulations for the first time, I didn't understand what I was looking at, so I read some papers
            and ran some experiments. The experiments left me confused, so I kept playing around until I could explain what
            was going on. That's how I wrote my first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/isal_a_00728" target="_blank">paper</a>
            while on hiatus from my startup. After that, I still couldn't explain everything, so I wrote some equations and did
            some more experiments. That's how I made my second major discovery, etc...
        </p>

        <br>

        <p><b>Q</b>: Are you going to grad school?</p>
        <p>
            <b>A</b>: IDK, I probably should, but only under the right advisor. Greatly appreciate any recommendations!
