              "# Reinforcement Learning and Oseledets Subspaces in Dynamical Systems \u2013 Key Papers\n\n## **Physics-Guided Actor-Critic RL for Swimming in Turbulence (Koh *et al.*, 2025)**  \n**Publication:** *Phys. Rev. Research* **7**, 013121 (2025)\u301014\u2020L101-L104\u3011.  \n**Summary:** Koh, Pagnier, and Chertkov develop a **physics-informed actor-critic RL algorithm** (the \u201cActor-Physicist\u201d) for controlling a particle in a turbulent flow\u301041\u2020L13-L22\u3011\u301041\u2020L29-L37\u3011. The critic network is replaced by an analytical model (\u201cphysicist\u201d) that leverages **dynamical systems insights** \u2013 notably **Lyapunov exponents from Oseledets\u2019 theorem** \u2013 to estimate the value function\u301041\u2020L29-L37\u3011\u301018\u2020L428-L437\u3011. By incorporating the **Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem** (which guarantees that the chaotic flow\u2019s strain dynamics have fixed orthonormal eigen-directions and exponential rates\u301018\u2020L428-L437\u3011), the authors guide the RL agent with knowledge of the flow\u2019s most unstable directions (the leading Lyapunov exponent). This hybrid approach significantly outperforms standard RL in maintaining two particles\u2019 proximity in chaotic flow environments\u301041\u2020L19-L22\u3011. *Key insight:* The paper explicitly connects RL control with **Oseledets subspaces** by using the **leading Lyapunov exponent and its corresponding invariant subspace** of the flow to inform the RL critic, thereby stabilizing learning in a chaotic dynamical system.\n\n## **Control and Anti-Control of Chaos via Moving Lyapunov Exponent (Han *et al.*, 2021)**  \n**Publication:** *Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena* **428**, 133068 (2021)\u301024\u2020L49-L57\u3011.  \n**Summary:** Han, Ding, Du, and Lei propose an RL-based method to **suppress or induce chaos** in dynamical systems by actively manipulating the system\u2019s **largest Lyapunov exponent**\u301024\u2020L37-L45\u3011. They design a reward function that depends on a **\u201cmoving\u201d largest Lyapunov exponent**, which is repeatedly estimated from recent state trajectories\u301024\u2020L37-L45\u3011. By rewarding the agent for decreasing this exponent (for chaos control) or increasing it (for chaos promotion), the RL algorithm effectively learns policies that steer the system toward stable or chaotic regimes. Although the paper doesn\u2019t mention \u201cOseledets subspaces\u201d by name, it *directly links RL to Oseledets theory* through the largest Lyapunov exponent (the top Oseledets exponent) of the system. The approach is demonstrated on classic chaotic maps (e.g. the H\u00e9non map) and the Lorenz system, showing that the agent can reliably adjust the system\u2019s Lyapunov spectrum\u301024\u2020L37-L45\u3011. *Key insight:* This work ties RL to the **Oseledets framework** by using the **maximal Lyapunov exponent as a feedback signal** \u2013 essentially training an RL agent to alter the Oseledets (Lyapunov) exponent and thus the corresponding invariant subspace\u2019s stability, achieving control of chaos.\n\n## **Lyapunov-Exponent Regularization for Robust RL (Young & Pugeault, 2024)**  \n**Publication:** 38th Conf. on Neural Information Processing Systems (*NeurIPS* 2024)\u301042\u2020L21-L25\u3011; also arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.10674.  \n**Summary:** Young and Pugeault investigate the **stability of deep RL policies** and find that even well-performing controllers can produce **deterministically chaotic dynamics**, meaning small state perturbations lead to diverging trajectories\u301028\u2020L73-L81\u3011. To address this, they introduce a regularization term based on the **maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE)** of the closed-loop system\u301028\u2020L79-L85\u3011. Their improved agent (built on the DreamerV3 architecture) penalizes large positive Lyapunov exponents during training, thereby **reducing chaos in the learned policy\u2019s dynamics**\u301028\u2020L73-L81\u3011. Empirically, this **Lyapunov regularization** makes RL policies more robust to sensor noise and adversarial perturbations\u301028\u2020L79-L85\u3011. *Key insight:* This paper explicitly connects RL with Oseledets theory by recognizing the agent\u2013environment system as a dynamical system with an associated **Lyapunov spectrum**. By **minimizing the top Lyapunov exponent** (the hallmark of an Oseledets unstable subspace), the method biases the agent toward policies that operate in more stable (less chaotic) dynamical subspaces, improving real-world reliability.\n\n## **FTLE Analysis of Controlled Trajectories (Krishna *et al.*, 2023)**  \n**Publication:** arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.03326 (2023) (authors later published in IEEE Access, 2023).  \n**Summary:** Krishna, Brunton, and Song use **finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE)** \u2013 a tool from dynamical systems that generalizes Lyapunov exponents to finite horizons \u2013 to analyze paths generated by **RL and model-predictive control (MPC)** in unsteady fluid flows\u301029\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301029\u2020L22-L30\u3011. They introduce the notion of \u201ccontrolled FTLE (cFTLE)\u201d fields, which reveal how an agent\u2019s policy deforms the flow\u2019s coherent structures\u301029\u2020L19-L28\u3011. Remarkably, they find that **RL-driven vehicles induce FTLE partitions** (separatrices) in the flow that segment regions by **difficulty of traversal or transport cost**, and these partitions shift with the controller\u2019s hyperparameters\u301029\u2020L21-L30\u3011. In other words, the RL policy interacts with the dynamical system\u2019s Oseledets subspaces \u2013 creating new effective stable/unstable manifolds in the flow depending on the control law. Identifying these manifolds helps in understanding optimal routes and tuning controller parameters\u301029\u2020L21-L30\u3011. *Key insight:* This work explicitly marries RL with Oseledets-type analysis by using **Lyapunov exponent fields** as a lens to interpret and improve controlled trajectories. It shows that an RL policy, when viewed as part of a dynamical system, gives rise to its own **Oseledets decomposition (coherent structures and invariant manifolds)** in the environment, thus highlighting a concrete relationship between RL decision-making and the underlying dynamical subspaces.\n\n**Sources:** The summaries above draw on the papers\u2019 abstracts and findings\u301018\u2020L428-L437\u3011\u301024\u2020L37-L45\u3011\u301028\u2020L79-L85\u3011\u301029\u2020L19-L28\u3011, which explicitly discuss both reinforcement learning and aspects of Oseledets\u2019 theory (Lyapunov exponents, invariant subspaces) in a unified context. Each publication provides a unique perspective on how **RL algorithms can engage with the Oseledets subspaces of a dynamical system** \u2013 either by **leveraging them for better control** or by **altering them to achieve desired stability**."

              "# Reinforcement Learning and Oseledets\u2019 Theorem \u2013 Key References\n\nBelow we list several works that explicitly discuss **reinforcement learning (RL)** in conjunction with the **Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem (MET)** (or *Oseledets subspaces/Lyapunov exponents). Each entry provides full citation details, a link, and a concise summary of how the two topics are connected:\n\n1. **Arnab Basu, T. Bhattacharyya & Vivek S. Borkar (2008)** \u2013 *\u201cA Learning Algorithm for Risk-Sensitive Cost.\u201d* **Mathematics of Operations Research** 33(4): 880\u2013898.  \n   *Link:* DOI: 10.1287/moor.1080.0324 (INFORMS)\u301049\u2020L1328-L1331\u3011.  \n   *Summary:* This paper introduced a **model-free RL algorithm with linear function approximation** for infinite-horizon **risk-sensitive** Markov decision processes, where the objective is to minimize an *exponential* (multiplicative) cost criterion. The authors prove convergence of their algorithm using the ODE method for stochastic approximation, **explicitly relying on the multiplicative ergodic theorem** (Oseledets\u2019 theorem for Markov chains) to ensure the existence of a well-defined risk-sensitive value function. In particular, the MET guarantees that the limit defining the risk-sensitive value (the principal Lyapunov exponent/eigenvalue of a certain positive operator) exists and is independent of initial state\u301042\u2020L622-L626\u3011. This allows the risk-sensitive *Bellman equation* to be cast as a multiplicative Poisson equation, providing a foundation for their RL algorithm. (Basu *et al.* cite Balaji & Meyn 2000 \u2013 the MET for Markov chains \u2013 as a key theoretical tool.)\n\n2. **Prasenjit Karmakar & Shalabh Bhatnagar (2021)** \u2013 *\u201cOn Tight Bounds for Function Approximation Error in Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning.\u201d* **Systems & Control Letters** 150: 104899.  \n   *Link:* [Article @ ScienceDirect](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysconle.2021.104899) (see also arXiv:1612.07562).  \n   *Summary:* This letter provides **error bounds for value-function approximation** under a **risk-sensitive RL** setting (exponential utility). It builds on the policy-evaluation algorithm of Basu *et al.* (2008) and offers tighter error estimates. Crucially, the authors **invoke Oseledets\u2019 multiplicative ergodic theorem** to handle the exponential cost criterion. They note that unlike the standard (risk-neutral) case \u2013 where a simple ergodic average suffices \u2013 *\u201cone needs to apply the multiplicative ergodic theorem\u2026 when the cost is risk-sensitive.\u201d*\u301042\u2020L586-L593\u3011. Using the MET for irreducible Markov chains ensures that the *risk-sensitive value (principal eigenvalue)* exists\u301042\u2020L622-L626\u3011, allowing the derivation of error bounds based on Perron\u2013Frobenius eigenvectors of the underlying transition-cost matrix. In summary, this work explicitly connects RL with Oseledets\u2019 theorem by analyzing how function-approximation errors behave in the multiplicative (risk-sensitive) regime, where the **value function is characterized as a leading Lyapunov exponent** rather than an additive cost.\n\n3. **M. Moharrami, Y. Murthy, A. Roy & R. Srikant (2022)** \u2013 *\u201cA Policy Gradient Algorithm for the Risk-Sensitive Exponential Cost MDP.\u201d* arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.04157 (Aug 2022).  \n   *Link:* [arXiv:2202.04157](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04157)\u301046\u2020L58-L61\u3011\u301047\u2020L4861-L4864\u3011.  \n   *Summary:* This recent work develops a **trajectory-based policy gradient method** for **risk-sensitive reinforcement learning** with an exponential cost criterion. The authors highlight that risk-sensitive MDPs lead to a *\u201cmultiplicative form of [the] dynamic programming equation\u2026 unlike the classical [additive] MDP\u201d*\u301046\u2020L58-L61\u3011. To deal with this, they introduce a smoothed, truncated version of the exponential objective and prove that it approximates the true risk-sensitive cost. In their analysis, the **multiplicative ergodic theorem** is explicitly used to establish that the long-run risk-sensitive cost (the limit of the normalized log moment-generating function of costs) exists under each policy\u301047\u2020L4861-L4864\u3011. In other words, MET guarantees the convergence of the quantity `\u039b_\u03b8 = lim_{n\u2192\u221e}(1/n) ln E[exp(\u03b1\u2211_0^{n-1} C(X_i,U_i))]`, which defines the risk-sensitive value for policy \u03b8 as the top Lyapunov exponent of a policy-dependent operator. They show this limit corresponds to the **unique principal eigenvalue** of a transformed transition matrix\u301047\u2020L4865-L4873\u3011, and use this fact to derive policy gradient updates. Thus, the paper explicitly bridges RL and Oseledets\u2019 theorem by treating **policy evaluation as an eigenvalue problem** (with MET ensuring the eigenvalue\u2019s existence and uniqueness).\n\n4. **Christopher Koh, Laurent Pagnier & Michael Chertkov (2025)** \u2013 *\u201cPhysics-Guided Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Swimming in Turbulence.\u201d* **Phys. Rev.

The problem involves an agent trying to stay close to a passively advected particle in a turbulent flow, where chaos causes nearby trajectories to separate exponentially. The authors use Oseledets\u2019 theorem to characterize the flow\u2019s dynamics: *\u201caccording to the Oseledets theorem\u2026 at sufficiently large times\u201d* the stretching of infinitesimal perturbations is governed by fixed Lyapunov exponent values and directions\u301017\u2020L428-L436\u3011. In particular, the **leading Lyapunov exponent** of the flow quantifies the average exponential rate of separation of particle trajectories. They incorporate this insight into a **physics-informed actor-critic algorithm**: instead of a learned neural network critic, they use an analytically derived \u201cphysicist\u201d value function based on the flow\u2019s **average maximal Lyapunov exponent**\u301044\u2020L1059-L1067\u3011. By doing so, the RL agent is guided by knowledge of the flow\u2019s inherent chaotic divergence rates. The paper demonstrates that this Oseledets-informed critic stabilizes training and outperforms a standard RL approach in the turbulent environment. In summary, this work explicitly connects RL and Oseledets\u2019 MET by using **Lyapunov exponents (Oseledets\u2019 quantities)** as a heuristic to shape the RL algorithm for controlling chaotic dynamics.\n\nEach of the above works **explicitly mentions both reinforcement learning and Oseledets\u2019 multiplicative ergodic theorem (or its corollaries)**, and in each case the authors *directly explore their relationship* \u2013 whether by using MET to prove convergence of an RL algorithm, formulating risk-sensitive value functions via Oseledets\u2019 eigenvalues, or embedding Lyapunov exponents into an RL controller for a chaotic system. These references span theoretical foundations (risk-sensitive and robust RL) as well as applied domains (turbulence control), highlighting the emerging interplay between RL and Oseledets\u2019 ergodic theory in recent research.\n\n**Sources:** Basu *et al.*, 2008\u301049\u2020L1328-L1331\u3011; Karmakar & Bhatnagar, 2021\u301042\u2020L586-L593\u3011\u301042\u2020L622-L626\u3011; Moharrami *et al.*, 2022\u301046\u2020L58-L61\u3011\u301047\u2020L4861-L4864\u3011; Koh *et al.*, 2025\u301017\u2020L428-L436\u3011\u301044\u2020L1059-L1067\u3011."

              "# Reinforcement Learning with Oseledets and Invariant Subspaces \u2013 Key References\n\nBelow is a list of academic works that explicitly integrate reinforcement learning (RL) with concepts from dynamical systems such as **Oseledets subspaces (Lyapunov-based invariant subspaces)**, **invariant subspaces of operators**, or **tangent-space decompositions**. Each entry includes bibliographic details, source links, and a brief summary of how these geometrical/dynamical constructs are linked to RL:\n\n- **Koh, C., Pagnier, L., & Chertkov, M. (2025). _\u201cPhysics-guided actor-critic reinforcement learning for swimming in turbulence.\u201d_** Phys. Rev. Research **7**, 013121 (2025). \u2013 This work studies an RL agent controlling a particle in a chaotic fluid flow. It leverages **Oseledets\u2019s theorem** (the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem) to characterize the flow\u2019s chaos via Lyapunov exponents and their associated invariant subspaces. In particular, the authors note that at long times the Jacobian of the flow\u2019s evolution has a log-linear form whose eigenvectors converge to fixed orthonormal directions (the **Oseledets subspaces**) and eigenvalues converge to the Lyapunov exponents\u30109\u2020L499-L507\u3011. The RL algorithm (\u201cactor-physicist\u201d) uses this insight to incorporate physics domain knowledge \u2013 the Oseledets/Lyapunov analysis of particle separation \u2013 into the critic, improving stability in a turbulent environment.\n\n- **Le Lan, C., Tu, S., Rowland, M., Harutyunyan, A., Agarwal, R., Bellemare, M. G., & Dabney, W. (2023). _\u201cBootstrapped Representations in Reinforcement Learning.\u201d_** In *Proc. 40th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2023)*, PMLR 202: 20302\u201320334 (2023). \u2013 This paper analyzes value-function *representation learning* in RL through the lens of linear algebra and invariant subspaces. It proves that temporal-difference (TD) learning with multiple value-prediction auxiliary tasks converges to features spanning the **top-$d$ invariant subspace** of the state-transition operator under a given policy\u301026\u2020L55-L63\u3011. In other words, the learned feature space aligns with the leading $d$-dimensional eigenspace of the Markov chain\u2019s transition matrix $P^\u03c0$. The authors formally define a \u201ctop-$d$ invariant subspace\u201d (one spanned by eigenvectors with the $d$ largest eigenvalues) and show that TD gradient descent is attracted to this subspace, while any representation spanning a non-top-$d$ invariant subspace is an unstable fixed point\u301026\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u301026\u2020L61-L69\u3011. This links RL representation learning to a **decomposition of the state space** based on spectral (eigen-subspace) structure of the dynamics.\n\n- **Jang, J., Han, J., & Kim, J. (2023). _\u201cK-mixup: Data augmentation for offline reinforcement learning using mixup in a Koopman invariant subspace.\u201d_** *Expert Systems with Applications*, **225**, 120136 (2023). \u2013 This study introduces *Koopman-mixup (K-mixup)*, a method that exploits **Koopman operator theory** to perform data augmentation in offline RL. The Koopman operator linearizes nonlinear dynamics by lifting them into an invariant subspace of observables. K-mixup learns a finite-dimensional **Koopman-invariant subspace** \u2013 spanned by a set of basis functions (approximate eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator) \u2013 such that the system\u2019s nonlinear state transitions act linearly in that subspace\u301031\u2020L36-L44\u3011. Because dynamics are linear in this learned feature space, the authors can apply **mixup augmentation** (linear interpolations between state representations) while staying within the space of valid dynamics. This approach addresses the incompatibility of naive mixup with RL\u2019s sequential, nonlinear data\u301031\u2020L39-L47\u3011. By augmenting the offline dataset with interpolated trajectories in the Koopman-invariant latent space, K-mixup consistently improves policy learning (e.g. boosting offline RL performance on control benchmarks)\u301031\u2020L41-L48\u3011.\n\n- **Weissenbacher, M., Sinha, S., Garg, A., & Kawahara, Y. (2022). _\u201cKoopman Q-learning: Offline Reinforcement Learning via Symmetries of Dynamics.\u201d_** In *Proc. 39th ICML* (PMLR 162: 23645\u201323657, 2022). \u2013 This paper also employs **Koopman operator invariants** to improve RL, focusing on identifying symmetry transformations in dynamics. It learns a latent representation in which the nonlinear environment dynamics are captured by a **finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace**\u301037\u2020L530-L538\u3011. Within this subspace, the Koopman operator (and associated symmetry generators) act as finite matrices, enabling the discovery of Lie-group symmetries of the system. The authors\u2019 *KFC (Koopman Forward Conservative) Q-learning* algorithm uses this learned invariant subspace to generate new training samples: they apply the symmetry transformations in the latent space to create additional state transitions that respect the system\u2019s dynamics\u301037\u2020L533-L542\u3011\u301037\u2020L543-L551\u3011. By augmenting the offline dataset with these symmetry-derived transitions, the method better generalizes and achieves superior performance on offline RL benchmarks. The key insight is that a **decomposition of the dynamics** via a Koopman-invariant subspace yields a linear representation where one can easily identify and exploit invariances for RL.\n\n- **Young, R., & Pugeault, N. (2024). _\u201cEnhancing Robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Lyapunov Exponent Approach.\u201d_** In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 37* (NeurIPS 2024) \u2013 **to appear**. \u2013 This work explicitly brings in **Lyapunov exponents** (from Oseledets\u2019 theory) to measure and mitigate chaos in RL control policies. The authors demonstrate that even well-performing deep RL controllers for continuous control can exhibit *deterministic chaos*: tiny state perturbations lead to exponentially divergent future trajectories and reward outcomes\u301050\u2020L33-L41\u3011. They quantify this using the **maximal Lyapunov exponent** of the learned policy (estimated via local divergence rates in the agent\u2019s state dynamics). A positive exponent indicates sensitive dependence on initial conditions (chaos), undermining policy robustness. To counter this, the paper introduces a Lyapunov-exponent regularization term in the training objective, penalizing chaos. By actively **reducing the maximal Lyapunov exponent** of the policy, they manage to stabilize the agent\u2019s dynamics\u301050\u2020L42-L47\u3011. This yields more reliable and noise-resilient policies, as lower Lyapunov exponents mean perturbations decay or grow slowly. In summary, this work links RL and tangent-space dynamics by using Lyapunov exponents as a tool to enforce stability, effectively constraining the policy to operate in regimes with a \u201cless chaotic\u201d **tangent-space behavior**.\n\nEach of the above references explicitly invokes concepts like Oseledets splittings, invariant subspaces, or tangent-space analysis in an RL setting \u2013 either to analyze an RL algorithm\u2019s behavior or to enhance learning and control through insights from dynamical systems theory. The incorporation of these geometric dynamical constructs is central to the methods or analysis presented in these works, illustrating a fruitful intersection of reinforcement learning with advanced topics in ergodic theory and operator theory.\n\n**Sources:** The content above is supported by excerpts from the papers \u2013 for example, see Koh *et al.* on Oseledets theorem and eigenvector convergence\u30109\u2020L499-L507\u3011, Le Lan *et al.* on RL representations converging to an invariant eigenspace\u301026\u2020L55-L63\u3011, Jang *et al.* on learning a Koopman invariant subspace for mixup augmentation\u301031\u2020L36-L44\u3011, Weissenbacher *et al.* on finite-dimensional Koopman invariant subspaces for dynamics\u301037\u2020L530-L538\u3011, and Young & Pugeault on measuring chaos in RL via Lyapunov exponents\u301050\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301050\u2020L42-L47\u3011.

K-mixup learns a Koopman invariant subspace to incorporate mixup augmentation, commonly used for classification tasks, into an RL framework. Mixup augmentation itself is known to be incompatible with RL because RL generally uses nonlinearly propagating state- based sequential inputs, whereas mixup relies on linear interpolation between a pair of inputs. To resolve the problem, Koopman embedding is used to convert a nonlinear system to a linear system, allowing successful mixup on arbitrary data",

We demonstrate that RL policies can be deterministically chaotic, as small perturbations to the system state have a large impact on subsequent state and reward trajectories. This unstable non-linear behaviour has two consequences: first, inaccuracies in sensor readings, or adversarial attacks, can cause significant performance degradation; second, even policies that show robust performance in terms of rewards may have unpredictable behaviour in practice. These two facets of chaos in RL policies drastically restrict the",
