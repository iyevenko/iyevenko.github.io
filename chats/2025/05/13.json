This asymmetry is the crucial ecological fact behind the argument below.\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis\n\n> **Humans evolved ever-richer internal world models primarily because, in ecologically realistic, high-dimensional environments, *model-based control is the only way to make the required number of good decisions within the limited data budget of a single lifetime*.**  \n>   \n> In short: **(a) sample-efficiency pressure**, not the logical impossibility claimed by (b), drove the change.\n\n---\n\n### Why (a) is a compelling explanation\n\n1. **Sample-efficiency gap scales super-linearly with dimensionality.**  \n   In an \\(n\\)-dimensional task a pure value learner must visit \\(O(\\text{poly}(\\varepsilon^{-1})^n)\\) state\u2013action pairs to fill its table to \u03b5-accuracy.  A world model that exploits compositional structure (objects, physics, social agency) collapses this to near-linear.  Empirical work in RL shows a two-to-three-order-of-magnitude data advantage for model-based agents in Atari, MuJoCo, board games, etc.\n\n2. **Episodic length constraints.**  \n   Hunter-gatherers face maybe \\(10^{7}\\) distinct foraging or social episodes in a lifetime\u2014far below what a model-free agent needs to approximate optimal behaviour in those same state spaces.  A generative model enables *mental roll-outs* (\u201cthinking\u201d) that multiply that data by orders of magnitude at negligible bodily risk.\n\n3. **Transfer and compositional generalisation.**  \n   A learned dynamics prior over objects and causal relations lets Homo sapiens instantaneously act sensibly in never-seen situations (stone tool fracture, animal tracking, boat construction).  Model-free caches have minimal ability to extrapolate outside the convex hull of past experience.\n\n4. **Neural and metabolic evidence.**  \n   Cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum\u2014organs implicated in generative modelling and forward simulation\u2014are vastly enlarged in humans relative to primate baselines despite their high metabolic cost, exactly as predicted if compute-cost is accepted in exchange for big reductions in learning-cost.\n\n---\n\n### Why (b) is unpersuasive as a *general* claim\n\n* **Counter-example classes exist.**  \n  In well-shaped problems with *huge* experience budgets (e.g.\\ insect phototaxis, fruit-fly courtship, habitual walking), genetic or procedural-memory policies tuned by selection suffice\u2014no explicit model is present.  The optimal policy is reachable because the effective state manifold is tiny or the reward structure is densely informative.\n\n* **Theoretical results.**  \n  PAC-MDP and policy-gradient theorems guarantee convergence to \\(\\pi^\\*\\) *without* an explicit dynamics model, given enough samples.  Thus modelling is *not* logically necessary; it\u2019s an engineering shortcut under tight sample budgets.\n\n---\n\n### Open questions and current evidence weighing\n\n| point favouring (a) | point favouring (b) |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Environments confronted by late Pleistocene hominins are combinatorial (tool use, cooperative hunting, language). Without models, lifetime data are insufficient. | Some sophisticated tasks (e.g. elite athletic skills) become almost reflexively model-free with practice, hinting that pure control laws *can* approximate optimality after enough repetition. |\n| Cross-domain transfer observed in children (intuitive physics \u2192 tool use; intuitive psychology \u2192 social bargaining) is best explained by a shared latent dynamics model. | No definitive neurally-decoded \u201cworld-simulator\u2019\u2019 has been isolated; some argue the brain\u2019s forward activity can be re-expressed as value-coding microcircuits. |\n\nCurrent comparative cognition, developmental psychology, and RL benchmarking overwhelmingly support **(a)** as the stronger pressure.  There is **no principled theorem** forbidding shortcut policies; there is decisive *ecological* evidence that, under realistic data limits, shortcut policies are *too slow to learn.*\n\n> **My judgement:** the sample-efficiency argument (a) is the main driver.  Humans build ever-better world models because doing so slashes \\(C_{\\text{learn}}\\) while keeping \\(C_{\\text{compute}}\\) within the metabolic budget, and evolution favours that trade-off."

              "A well-founded hypothesis is that humans developed sophisticated world models at least partly because, in extremely complex environments, exploiting environmental structure via a compressed model becomes more tractable than trying to learn an action-value map purely from episodic experience. Yet it may also reflect that certain critical forms of near-optimal decision-making fundamentally require (explicit or implicit) modeling of state dynamics, leaving limited shortcuts. It is probably a bit of both, and we can lay out some arguments for each perspective:\n\n1. **Efficiency Hypothesis (a)**  \n   *In complicated environments, learning an approximate world model is more data-efficient.*  \n   - **Extrapolation to unseen scenarios**: If an agent (or a human) has a learned representation of how the world evolves, they can simulate or reason about new situations *without* directly experiencing them. This is more sample-efficient than a purely model-free system that must rely on trial-and-error for every novel case.  \n   - **Reusability & compositionality**: A world model can be re-used across many tasks, while a model-free policy or Q-function is often task-specific. Having a flexible world model that encapsulates core dynamics can accelerate learning when tasks or goals change.  \n   - **Planning capabilities**: By modeling the environment, one can \u201croll out\u201d hypothetical sequences of states and compare possible actions in imagination, even if those actions are high-stakes or dangerous to attempt in reality.\n\n2. **Fundamental Necessity Hypothesis (b)**  \n   *Near-optimal policies require capturing (or approximating) full transition distributions.*  \n   - **Complex dynamics**: When the environment has hidden interactions and non-trivial dynamics, you need to track internal causal structure in order to make accurate long-horizon predictions or solve certain high-level tasks.  \n   - **Exploiting system geometry**: Without at least an implicit model of how states connect, it can be impossible to plan multi-step routes, discover shortcuts, or do hierarchical reasoning.  \n   - **Informational completeness**: Some environments might hide no \u201cshortcuts\u201d in the sense that each state-action leads to a unique distribution of next states not predictable by simpler statistics. In that case, to behave optimally, the agent\u2019s internal representation must encode enough detail to reconstruct that distribution or an equivalent.  \n\n### Discussion\n\nEmpirically, humans do maintain **both** a large repertoire of *cached habits* (model-free in character) *and* the ability to plan or reason from an internal world model (model-based). Our neural machinery balances these two extremes. Some decisions, especially well-practiced ones (like automatic routines), rely more on learned, \u201cmodel-free\u201d patterns. Other decisions, especially novel, strategic, or high-stakes ones, rely heavily on mental simulation of the environment\u2014i.e. a \u201cworld model.\u201d\n\nWe see evidence in developmental psychology that children build *increasingly sophisticated* mental models. Part of this might be that humans\u2019 environment is vast and changing, so new tasks or contingencies arise\u2014making a flexible approximate model indispensable. But it might also be driven by the fundamental difficulties of solving complex planning problems by raw trial and error.\n\n### The verdict\n\nIt\u2019s likely **both**. The first position (efficiency) suggests that while a purely model-free approach can eventually yield policies that *approximate* near-optimal behavior, the data and computational demands for that approach grow quickly in complex or changing environments. Building a compressed internal model is a good evolutionary strategy because it dramatically cuts down on the needed real-world data and fosters general-purpose problem solving. On the other hand, the second position (fundamental necessity) also has strong arguments: *some* tasks in the real world effectively require knowledge of the environment\u2019s causal or structural aspects for robust near-optimal behavior.\n\nThat said, if forced to guess which factor is *primary*, the **efficiency** argument (a) likely plays the biggest role in an evolutionary context. Even if near-optimal policies *could* theoretically emerge from purely model-free processes, nature might have found it far more efficient\u2014and thus more likely\u2014to encode internal models for strategic planning, because the cost of learning *only* from trial and error in a high-dimensional environment with frequent changes and hidden dangers would be prohibitively high."

              "A drifting (\u201cnon-stationary\u201d) state distribution is **one of the strongest pressures** that pushes an organism toward maintaining an explicit or implicit world-model\u2014but it is not the *only* one.  Here is why it matters and where its explanatory power stops.\n\n---\n\n### 1\u2003Why non-stationarity makes model-free caching brittle  \n\nLet \\(d_t(s)\\) denote the agent\u2019s on-policy state distribution at time \\(t\\).\n\n* **Model-free value caching assumes slow drift**  \n  A cached \\(Q(s,a)\\) is an average over the *past* trajectory distribution  \n  \\[\n    Q(s,a) \\approx \\mathbb{E}_{d_{\\le t}}\\bigl[ R+\\gamma V(s') \\mid s,a\\bigr].\n  \\]  \n  If \\(d_t\\) shifts before the cache is refreshed, those averages become biased for the *new* regime. The agent will exploit stale statistics and suffer regret.\n\n* **World-models update faster**  \n  A dynamics estimate \\(\\hat P(s'|s,a)\\) can be corrected from *single* transitions, not multi-step returns.  Once \\(\\hat P\\) moves, planning immediately recomputes new Q-values\u2014even for states not yet re-visited under the new distribution.  That responsiveness is a big advantage in volatile niches (changing seasons, technology, social coalitions, predator tactics).\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003But stationarity alone does *not* eliminate the need for models  \n\nEven with a perfectly stationary \\(P\\) and reward function \\(R\\):\n\n1. **Sparse or hazardous data**\u2003If certain high-impact states are rarely (or cannot safely be) sampled, a model that extrapolates from structure is the *only* way to evaluate actions there.  \n2. **Long-horizon compositional tasks**\u2003Building a shelter, planning a hunt, or coordinating a group requires simulating multi-step contingencies.  Enumerative trial-and-error would take astronomical time even in a stationary world.  \n3. **Partial observability**\u2003Animals never get the full Markov state; they infer hidden variables (predator location, partner intent) from observations.  That inference *is* an internal dynamical model.  \n4. **Transfer across goals**\u2003Homo sapiens regularly re-optimises for new reward structures (e.g. social norms, invented tools).  A reusable transition model amortises the cost across tasks.\n\nThus non-stationarity is a *sufficient* but not a *necessary* condition for the evolutionary payoff of model-based cognition.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Putting it together  \n\n| Selective pressure | Does non-stationarity create it? | Does a world-model help? |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Distribution shift / concept drift | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n| Rare-event reasoning | Not required | **Yes** |\n| Long-horizon planning | Not required | **Yes** |\n| Hidden-state inference | Not required | **Yes** |\n| Task transfer / meta-learning | Sometimes | **Yes** |\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003My synthesis  \n\n*Non-stationarity was probably an early and ever-present driver*\u2014think Ice-Age cycles, migrating prey, or shifting social alliances.  Once the neural machinery for predictive modeling was in place, **other advantages (planning, imagination, counterfactual reasoning)** made it indispensable even in locally stationary niches.  \n\nSo: **non-stationary state distributions are a primary trigger, but the resulting cognitive architecture remains useful far beyond that scenario.**"

The system, with no forcing input and friction only at the joint, could lead to the cart continuing to move due to the coupling with the pole's pendulum motion. Gravity provides stable equilibrium, but energy dissipation from viscous damping alone may not be enough to fully stop horizontal motion, especially considering the cart's freedom on track without friction."

In the standard cartpole model, the upright equilibrium (\u03b8 = 0) is unstable due to gravity, meaning any small deviation results in the pendulum losing balance. This clarification helps identify that with damping, the pendulum would naturally reach the stable downward position, \u03b8 = \u03c0."

The coupling between the cart and pendulum initially transfers momentum, but after the pendulum stops, the cart's velocity stays unchanged. With no external horizontal force, horizontal momentum is conserved, and the cart continues moving at a steady velocity. This suggests that the system's equilibrium includes a constant velocity for the cart, although it\u2019s not technically \u201czero\u201d velocity in steady-state."

Potential energy changes with \u03b8, and I need to confirm if the bottom position is stable at \u03b8 = 0 or \u03b8 = \u03c0, as we've seen different conclusions earlier."

Convergence proofs (e.g. in Lyapunov-based actor-critic or \u201csafe RL\u201d) rely on \\(V\\) being valid when \\(u=0\\).\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Well-known families that fit your template\n\n* **Port-Hamiltonian / passive mechanical systems**  \n  \\(f(s)=\\bigl[J(s)-R(s)\\bigr]\\nabla H(s)\\) with \\(R\\succeq0\\).  \n  \\(H\\) is the Hamiltonian (energy) \u21d2 global Lyapunov function.\n\n* **Gradient-like diffusion models** (e.g. Langevin dynamics)  \n  \\(f(s)=-\\nabla U(s)\\) stable, \\(g(u)=B\\,u\\). Used in stochastic control and RL for sampling-based policy updates.\n\n* **Neural ODE residual control**  \n  In meta-RL one often writes \\(\\dot s = f_{\\text{phys}}(s)+\\pi_\\theta(s)\\) where \\(f_{\\text{phys}}\\) is known, passive, and \\(\\pi_\\theta\\) is the learned residual-policy network.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Bottom line\n\n*The decomposition \\(\\dot s = f(s)+g(u),\\;g(0)=0\\) is universal.*  \nRequiring **asymptotic stability of \\(f\\)** is an additional modelling choice:  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 common and useful when safety/energy considerations dominate (industrial control, port-Hamiltonian robotics, safe RL);  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 intentionally **not** assumed in benchmarks that test a controller\u2019s ability to create stability from scratch.\n\nSo if your application naturally has a damping, gravity, or thermodynamics mechanism giving \\(f\\) a Lyapunov function, exploiting that structure is both well-known and strongly recommended in modern control and reinforcement-learning practice."

Some concepts like passivity and CLF don\u2019t need a symmetric Jacobian either.

Apart from the linear-time-invariant case, there is **no general statement** that the closed-loop Jacobian is symmetric, skew-symmetric, lower-triangular, etc.\n\n---\n\n### Dynamic (state-space) feedback\n\nIf the controller has its own internal state \\(z\\),\n\n\\[\n\\dot z = \\phi(z,s),\\quad u=\\psi(z,s),\n\\]\n\nthe plant and controller are combined into an augmented system  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\dot s\\\\\\dot z\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}f(s)+G(s)\\psi(z,s)\\\\[2pt]\\phi(z,s)\\end{bmatrix},\n\\]\n\nand the Jacobian of that block system follows directly from partial derivatives of \\(\\phi,\\psi,f,G\\) \u2014 again with no special structural guarantees unless enforced by design (e.g., backstepping yields a strict-lower-triangular Jacobian in transformed coordinates).\n\n---\n\n## Take-away\n\n* For a **static state feedback** \\(u=k(s)\\), the closed-loop Jacobian is given by equation (2):  \n  \\(J_{\\text{cl}} = \\partial f/\\partial s + \\sum k_i\\,\\partial g_i/\\partial s + G\\,\\partial k/\\partial s\\).\n\n* Any *special* property of \\(J_{\\text{cl}}\\) (symmetry, sign definiteness, triangularity) is **not automatic**; it must be obtained either from intrinsic plant structure (e.g., port-Hamiltonian) **or** from deliberate controller design (e.g., linearisation, backstepping, energy shaping).\n\nThus the control-affine form is universal, but its Jacobian gains extra feedback-gradient terms whose properties depend entirely on the chosen feedback law and modelling framework."

              "Below is a compact \u201cdictionary\u201d that shows how the control-affine ODE\n\n\\[\n\\dot s = f(s)\\;+\\;G(s)\\,u ,\\qquad G(s)\\,0 = 0 ,\n\\]\n\nwith a Lyapunov function \\(V\\) for the **drift** \\(f\\), translates almost verbatim into the usual formalism of continuous-time Markov Decision Processes (CTMDPs) and into the algorithms used in continuous-time reinforcement learning.\n\n---\n\n### 1\u2003State dynamics  \n*Control theory*\u2003Deterministic ODE above.  \n*CTMDP*\u2003The generator of the controlled process is  \n\n\\[\n\\mathcal L^{u} \\phi(s)\\;=\\;\\nabla\\phi(s)^{\\!\\top}\\bigl(f(s)+G(s)u\\bigr)\n\\]\n\nfor any smooth test function \\(\\phi\\).  If stochastic process noise \\(\\sigma(s)\\,dW_t\\) is present, add \\(\\tfrac12\\mathrm{tr}\\bigl[\\sigma\\sigma^{\\!\\top}\\nabla^2\\phi\\bigr]\\); nothing else changes.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003Policy  \n*Control theory*\u2003A feedback law \\(u=\\pi(s)\\).  \n*CTMDP/RL*\u2003Exactly the same object; \\(\\pi\\) is the agent\u2019s policy.

A pre-existing Lyapunov function for \\(f\\) can therefore be:\n\n* a control-Lyapunov function template,\n* an initialization or guide for the critic,\n* a safety certificate (Lyapunov-based safe RL).\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Passivity and dissipativity in RL language  \nBecause \\(f\\) is already asymptotically stable, the uncontrolled system is *self-regulating*.  In RL this corresponds to an environment whose \u201cdo-nothing\u201d policy keeps the state bounded (the return is finite even with \\(u\\equiv0\\)).  Strict passivity (\\(\\dot V\\le -\\nu\\|v\\|^{2}\\)) implies **input-to-state stability**; in policy-gradient proofs this appears as the boundedness of importance-weighting factors and guarantees convergence.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Policy gradients  \nFor differentiable policies the policy-gradient theorem reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta)\n =\\int \\rho^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s)\\,\n      \\bigl[\\nabla V^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s)\\bigr]^{\\!\\top}\n      G(s)\\,\\nabla_{\\theta}\\pi_{\\theta}(s)\\;ds,\n\\]\n\nidentical in form to classical **energy-shaping** or **CLF-QP** formulas in nonlinear control, where \\(\\nabla V\\;G\\) gives the *descent direction* and \\(\\pi_{\\theta}\\) chooses a point along it.\n\n---\n\n### 6\u2003Why benchmarks often drop the Lyapunov drift  \nIn many MuJoCo or robotics tasks the drift \\(f\\) is *unstable* (inverted pendulum, bipedal gaits).  This forces the agent to learn *both* stabilization and reward maximization, making the benchmark harder.  When safety is paramount (industrial control, power-grid RL, safe exploration) designers *do* keep a stable \\(f\\) and exploit the Lyapunov structure exactly as outlined above.\n\n---\n\n### 7\u2003Summary of the mapping  \n\n| Classical control term | Continuous-time RL / CTMDP term |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Drift \\(f(s)\\) with Lyapunov \\(V\\) | Uncontrolled CTMDP dynamics; \\(V\\) is a candidate critic and safety function |\n| Control vector field \\(G(s)\\) | Action influence on transition rates |\n| Feedback law \\(u=\\pi(s)\\) | Policy |\n| Energy dissipation \\(\\dot V\\le -W(s)\\) | Input-to-state stability, safe RL constraint |\n| CLF / HJB equality | Value-function Bellman equation |\n| Energy-shaping / passivity-based control | Actor update following policy-gradient theorem |\n\nThus the decomposition \\(\\dot s = f(s)+G(s)u\\) with a stable \\(f\\) is not merely \u201csimilar\u201d to CTMDP models\u2014it *is* the canonical continuous-time RL setting, and the classical Lyapunov machinery carries over directly into modern actor-critic and safe-RL algorithms."

              "# Dynamical Systems Perspectives in Reinforcement Learning\n\n## Introduction  \nReinforcement Learning (RL) is fundamentally intertwined with dynamical systems. An RL agent interacts with an environment that evolves over time, and the agent\u2019s learning process itself can be viewed as a dynamical system. This review surveys how key concepts from dynamical systems theory \u2013 **attractors**, **Lyapunov exponents**, **flows and semiflows**, **phase space volume**, and the **continuity equation** \u2013 have been applied to RL and autonomous agents. We trace the evolution of these ideas, highlighting foundational theoretical work that provides a unifying dynamical-systems lens on RL. The focus is on general theoretical insights (independent of specific application domains), with equations and formalisms included to clarify concepts.\n\n## Attractors and Fixed Points in RL  \nIn dynamical systems theory, an *attractor* is a set of states toward which a system tends to evolve. In RL, attractors appear in several guises. **Optimal solutions** of RL problems often correspond to fixed-point attractors of iterative algorithms. For example, the Bellman optimality equation defines a fixed-point for the value function; value iteration converges to this solution which is a stable fixed point (an *attractor*) under the Bellman operator\u2019s contraction mapping. Similarly, policy iteration or gradient-based policy optimization can be seen as producing sequences that (under idealized conditions) converge to an optimal policy \u2013 an attracting fixed point in policy space. Dynamical systems theory establishes that such fixed points are locally attracting if certain stability criteria are met (e.g. eigenvalues of the linearized update have magnitudes < 1), ensuring convergence of the RL algorithm\u2019s trajectory in parameter space\u301030\u2020L3075-L3082\u3011\u301030\u2020L3079-L3082\u3011.\n\nFrom the *environment* perspective, a fixed policy defines a **closed-loop system** (agent + environment) that is itself a dynamical system. If the policy is time-invariant, the closed-loop state evolution can be viewed as a map $s_{t+1}=f(s_t)$ in discrete time, or $\\dot{s}=f(s)$ in continuous time, where $f$ depends on the policy\u2019s actions. Such closed-loop dynamics may possess attractors. For instance, in control tasks an optimal policy often seeks to stabilize the environment at a **goal state**, which is a point attractor in the state space. Classic control goals \u2013 *stabilization* to an equilibrium, *trajectory tracking*, or maintaining state in a desired region \u2013 can be interpreted as ensuring the closed-loop system has the desired attractor (point or limit-cycle) with a basin of attraction covering relevant initial states\u301043\u2020L86-L94\u3011\u301043\u2020L115-L123\u3011. Early theoretical work in RL recognized the importance of this perspective. For example, Perkins and Barto (2002) noted that many control problems are not posed as optimal rewards but rather as qualitative objectives like keeping the state within a safe set or near an operating point\u301043\u2020L86-L94\u3011. They showed that by integrating \u201cqualitative\u201d control techniques (e.g. ensuring an attractor exists at a target state) into an RL framework, one can design agents that **bring the state to a goal region and keep it there** with guaranteed properties\u301043\u2020L107-L115\u3011\u301043\u2020L115-L123\u3011. In effect, the goal region becomes a robust attractor of the learned policy\u2019s closed-loop dynamics.\n\nAttractors also arise in the analysis of *multi-agent or game settings*. In two-player zero-sum games, for example, Nash equilibria can be attracting fixed points of learning dynamics (though not always \u2013 some learning dynamics cycle). Evolutionary game theory draws direct parallels between RL and *replicator dynamics* (a continuous-time flow on strategy space). Under small step sizes, certain RL algorithms (e.g. policy gradient in games, or Q-learning in simplified settings) can be approximated by deterministic ODEs that have fixed points corresponding to equilibria\u301030\u2020L3077-L3085\u3011\u301030\u2020L3098-L3106\u3011. If those equilibria are stable (attracting), learning will converge; if not, the learning dynamics may exhibit **limit cycles** or chaos instead of settling to a point. Understanding when RL dynamics lead to attractors versus cyclic or chaotic behavior is an ongoing area of research, as we discuss further below.\n\nIn summary, attractors provide a unifying notion of *solution stability* in RL. Whether referring to the convergence of an algorithm to an optimal value function/policy, or the tendency of a trained agent to drive a physical system to a goal state, the presence of an attractor (fixed point or stable cycle) is often what guarantees reliable long-term behavior. Much of theoretical RL is about ensuring such attractors exist and are reached. Techniques from dynamical systems, especially Lyapunov\u2019s direct method, are instrumental in these guarantees.\n\n## Lyapunov Functions and Stability in Reinforcement Learning  \n**Lyapunov functions** are a cornerstone of stability analysis in dynamical systems. A Lyapunov function $V(x)$ is a scalar function of the state $x$ that behaves like an \u201cenergy\u201d decreasing along trajectories of the system\u301043\u2020L117-L125\u3011. If one can find a $V(x)$ that always decreases (or stays constant) as the system evolves (except at a desired equilibrium), then that equilibrium is stable. This concept extends to systems with control inputs via *Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs)*: a CLF is a function for which, at each state, there exists some control action that causes $V$ to decrease\u30109\u2020L61-L69\u3011\u301043\u2020L141-L149\u3011. In control theory, CLFs provide a systematic way to design stabilizing controllers.\n\nIn the RL context, Lyapunov functions have been used to impose and verify stability of learned policies. An early theoretical contribution by Perkins and Barto (2002) introduced **Lyapunov design for safe reinforcement learning**, combining Lyapunov-based control with online learning\u30109\u2020L19-L27\u3011\u30109\u2020L61-L69\u3011. They assumed a set of *base controllers* each with known Lyapunov functions (domain knowledge of the system\u2019s dynamics), and then allowed the learning agent to switch among these controllers. Crucially, the base controllers were chosen so that **any switching policy is safe** \u2013 meaning the Lyapunov function for the overall system always decreases regardless of the sequence of controllers\u30109\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u30109\u2020L19-L27\u3011. By constraining the RL agent\u2019s actions to those that guarantee a decrease in $V(x)$, they ensured the agent\u2019s behavior remains **stable and within a safe region at all times**\u301043\u2020L141-L149\u3011. This yields *qualitative performance guarantees* (e.g. never leaving a viability set, or never letting the state diverge) directly from the Lyapunov descent condition\u301043\u2020L143-L150\u3011. In essence, the learned policy inherits the stability properties encoded by the Lyapunov function. This work was foundational in showing that RL could achieve **provably safe and stable control** by blending learning with classical Lyapunov analysis.\n\nSubsequent research built on these ideas, especially in the field of **safe reinforcement learning**. A notable example is the approach by Berkenkamp *et al.* (2017), who developed a *model-based* RL algorithm with stability guarantees\u301044\u2020L25-L33\u3011. They explicitly define safety in terms of Lyapunov stability: the goal is to keep the system in a region around an equilibrium where a Lyapunov condition holds. By using Gaussian Process models of the environment dynamics, their method can verify (with high confidence) a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system and thus certify that a candidate policy will not leave the safe region\u301044\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301011\u2020L25-L33\u3011. The policy is then improved cautiously, expanding the verified region as more data is collected. This yields **provable stability certificates** for learned policies \u2013 for example, they train a neural network controller for an inverted pendulum and guarantee it will never let the pendulum fall over\u301044\u2020L27-L34\u3011. In effect, the RL agent learns an optimal policy *subject to the constraint* that a Lyapunov function $V(x)$ stays decreasing, ensuring the equilibrium at \u201cupright\u201d remains an attractor throughout learning.\n\nMathematically, imposing Lyapunov stability in RL often means adding constraints or regularizers to the learning objective. For instance, one may require that for all states under the policy, there exists a decrease in $V$: $V(f(s,a)) - V(s) < 0$ for chosen action $a$ (discrete-time case) or $\\nabla V(s)\\cdot f(s,a) < 0$ (continuous-time). Algorithms have been devised to either **learn a Lyapunov function in tandem** with the policy or to utilize a known Lyapunov function to restrict exploration. In control-theoretic RL, it\u2019s common to assume a Lyapunov function of known form (e.g. a quadratic $x^TPx$ for linear systems) and then train a policy that satisfies the Lyapunov decrease condition. Recent research also uses *neural Lyapunov functions* \u2013 learning a neural network to represent $V(x)$ \u2013 along with RL, so that the network can certify the policy\u2019s stability over a wide state space.\n\nThe Lyapunov approach provides a **theoretical guarantee of stability** which pure reward optimization often lacks. Typically, standard deep RL might find a high-return policy that is **unstable** or unsafe (e.g. it gets high reward but only by balancing on a knife-edge that could tip over with a slight perturbation). Lyapunov analysis adds a layer of *robustness*: it ensures the learned behavior corresponds to a **dynamically stable solution**, not just a reward-optimal one. This is especially crucial in physical domains (robotics, autonomous driving, etc.) where uncontrolled divergence is dangerous. By bringing in Lyapunov functions, RL researchers have bridged the gap between **value optimality** and **system stability**, two notions that are not automatically aligned. In summary, Lyapunov-based theoretical frameworks enforce that the agent\u2019s policy makes progress toward (and stays near) the desired attractor (goal state or trajectory) in every step, providing rigorous confidence in the system\u2019s safety and convergence properties\u301043\u2020L147-L150\u3011\u30109\u2020L67-L73\u3011.\n\n## Chaos and Lyapunov Exponents in Learning Dynamics  \nNot all dynamical systems converge calmly to an attractor; some exhibit *chaotic dynamics*, characterized by extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and a positive **Lyapunov exponent** (exponential divergence of nearby trajectories). It has become increasingly clear that RL controllers \u2013 especially complex neural network policies in continuous control tasks \u2013 can induce **chaotic behavior** in the closed-loop system\u30101\u2020L33-L40\u3011\u30107\u2020L41-L49\u3011. In other words, a policy that performs well on average might nevertheless make the system\u2019s state evolution highly unpredictable in response to tiny perturbations.\n\n**Lyapunov exponents** quantify the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories. A positive *maximal Lyapunov exponent* (MLE) means two trajectories starting arbitrarily close will diverge exponentially on average \u2013 a hallmark of chaos. Recent studies (2023\u20132024) measured Lyapunov exponents of dynamical systems under learned RL controllers. For example, in continuous control benchmarks (like MuJoCo physics environments), Young and Pugeault (2024) found that the trained deep RL policies often produce *deterministically chaotic* state trajectories\u30101\u2020L33-L40\u3011. Small errors in state estimation (e.g. slight sensor noise) grew rapidly, leading to vastly different long-term outcomes\u30101\u2020L35-L43\u3011. They reported that even when reward performance is high, the agent\u2019s behavior may be unpredictable and fragile \u2013 essentially the system has no stable attractor in practice and can wander unpredictably in state space\u30101\u2020L39-L47\u3011. This lack of robust stability is problematic for real-world deployment, as a tiny bump or adversarial perturbation can knock the agent far off course.\n\nTo address this, researchers have proposed incorporating *Lyapunov exponent regularization* into the RL training objective. By penalizing a policy for having a positive Lyapunov exponent (or by directly minimizing the exponent), one can encourage the learning process to find **stable, non-chaotic** solutions\u30101\u2020L41-L47\u3011. In the work of Young & Pugeault (NeurIPS 2024), they augment a state-of-the-art RL algorithm (Dreamer) with a regularizer that estimates the local Lyapunov exponent of the policy and adds a loss term to reduce it\u30101\u2020L23-L27\u3011\u30101\u2020L39-L47\u3011. Empirically this led to policies that were slightly more conservative but significantly more robust: the state trajectories became more stable (neighboring trajectories did not blow apart), and performance under noise or perturbations improved\u30101\u2020L39-L47\u3011. This is a novel example of using a quintessential dynamical systems metric (Lyapunov exponent) as a training signal for RL.\n\nOn the flip side, RL has also been used deliberately to *control chaotic systems* \u2013 either to suppress chaos or to sustain it, depending on the goal. In control theory, the **anti-control of chaos** means introducing chaos where it was lost (for example, to avoid an undesirable stable equilibrium), while *chaos control* usually means stabilizing an otherwise chaotic system. Both objectives have seen creative RL applications. Han *et al.* (2021) designed an RL reward function specifically around the *moving largest Lyapunov exponent*, effectively asking the agent to achieve a desired exponent\u301026\u2020L74-L82\u3011. By doing so, they trained agents that could **stabilize** a chaotic system (make the largest Lyapunov exponent negative, producing an attractor) or, conversely, **\u201cchaotify\u201d** a system that had settled to a fixed point (make the exponent positive)\u301026\u2020L74-L82\u3011\u301026\u2020L83-L84\u3011. They demonstrated this on classical chaotic maps like the H\u00e9non map and the Lorenz attractor: one RL agent learned to apply controls that quench the chaos in the H\u00e9non map (trajectories quickly collapsed to a periodic orbit from chaos)\u301049\u2020L69-L77\u3011, while another learned to inject perturbations in the Lorenz system to **restore the chaotic attractor** after it would otherwise converge to a non-chaotic fixed point\u301040\u2020L45-L53\u3011\u301040\u2020L53-L56\u3011. This is remarkable because it shows RL achieving sophisticated control goals that are traditionally formulated in terms of dynamical systems theory \u2013 *without* the agent having an explicit model of the dynamics. The RL agent in these cases discovers either a stabilizing policy or a chaotifying policy purely through experience, guided by a reward that encodes the desired sign/magnitude of a Lyapunov exponent\u301026\u2020L75-L82\u3011.\n\nThese developments illustrate a rich interplay: on one hand, we want RL policies to avoid unintended chaotic behavior (impose stability for safety); on the other hand, RL can be a powerful tool to navigate and control chaos in systems where chaos might be useful or inherent (e.g. preventing a system from falling into an undesirable stable regime). The theoretical lens of *chaos theory* thus complements RL by providing metrics (Lyapunov exponents, attractor dimensions) to characterize the agent\u2019s dynamics, and by offering control objectives beyond classical stability (like sustaining chaos in a beneficial way). We might also note that chaos in the *learning process* itself has been studied: the parameter updates in deep RL algorithms are high-dimensional and non-linear \u2013 while typically modeled as stochastic approximation converging to an equilibrium, there is interest in whether training dynamics could ever become chaotic. This is largely an open question, but tools like Lyapunov exponents could in principle be applied to the parameter trajectory to diagnose erratic learning behavior. Overall, the introduction of Lyapunov exponents into RL research is a recent but growing trend, reinforcing the idea that RL-controlled systems should be analyzed with the same rigor as any dynamical system \u2013 including the possibility of chaos.\n\n## Flows, Semiflows, and State Distribution Dynamics  \nA *flow* in dynamical systems is a continuous-time evolution operator $\\phi^t$ that maps an initial state $s(0)$ to a state $s(t)$ at time $t$, satisfying the group property $\\phi^{t+s}(s_0)=\\phi^t(\\phi^s(s_0))$. A *semiflow* typically refers to a one-sided time evolution (for $t\\ge0$) which may not be invertible backward in time. In RL environments, time is often discrete, but we can still think of the state evolution under a fixed policy as generating a **semiflow** $\\{s_t\\}_{t\\ge0}$ on the state space: $s_{t+1} = F(s_t)$ (stochastic or deterministic). If the environment is a continuous-time controlled system $\\dot{s}=f(s,u)$ with a policy $u=\\pi(s)$, then $\\dot{s}=f(s,\\pi(s))$ defines a continuous **flow** on the state manifold (at least while $\\pi$ is fixed). This flow may possess invariants or steady-states; for instance, if the policy is stabilizing, the closed-loop flow will have an equilibrium (the goal) that is globally attracting. In general, analyzing RL from a flow perspective means examining how state trajectories (or distributions of states) *evolve over time* under the influence of the agent\u2019s policy.\n\nOne powerful approach in theoretical RL is to look at the **distribution of states** (or state-action pairs) induced by a policy, rather than just individual trajectories. For a given policy $\\pi$, one can define $\\mu_t(s)$ as the probability distribution of the state at time $t$ (over stochastic environment dynamics or random initial conditions). The evolution of $\\mu_t$ is given by a linear operator derived from the environment\u2019s transition kernel (the Markov chain). In continuous state spaces, this evolution can often be written as a **continuity equation** (also known as a transport or Kolmogorov forward equation): \n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\mu_t(s) + \\nabla\\cdot\\!\\big(v(s)\\,\\mu_t(s)\\big) = 0, \\]\n\nwhere $v(s)$ is the state \u201cvelocity\u201d field under the policy (the drift of the dynamics)\u301020\u2020L31-L34\u3011. This partial differential equation (PDE) asserts that the probability density $\\mu_t(s)$ moves with the flow defined by $v(s)$, conserving total probability (no mass is created or destroyed). In other words, it\u2019s the **fluid-flow view of state occupancy**: as states flow through phase space, the density changes such that any fixed region\u2019s probability mass changes only by flux across its boundary. This continuity equation is the same mathematical structure as **Liouville\u2019s equation** in Hamiltonian mechanics or the **Fokker\u2013Planck equation** in stochastic processes (with diffusion terms if needed). \n\nThe continuity equation perspective has yielded insightful theoretical connections. For example, in *mean-field reinforcement learning* (considering a large population of agents or an infinite-horizon limit), one often characterizes the aggregate effect of many agents via a **flow of probability measures**\u301018\u2020L80-L87\u3011. In mean-field games and mean-field control, as introduced by Lasry & Lions and Huang et al., the state distribution of the population evolves deterministically according to a PDE of Fokker\u2013Planck type (a continuity equation), while simultaneously each agent optimizes a cost given that evolving distribution. The \u201cmean field\u201d is essentially an occupancy measure that follows a continuity equation in time\u301018\u2020L80-L87\u3011. Richemond and Maginnis (2022) explicitly connect *Wasserstein gradient flows* (which are steepest descent flows in the space of probability distributions) to RL, showing that certain policy optimization processes can be interpreted as gradient flows on the distribution of trajectories, thereby obeying a continuity equation for the occupancy measure. This line of work treats policy improvement as a *flow in distribution space* \u2013 bridging RL with optimal transport theory and providing convergence guarantees by interpreting RL as minimizing a divergence or energy over distributions via a flow\u301020\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u301020\u2020L31-L34\u3011.\n\nA particularly elegant formulation was given by Kwee and Schmidhuber (2001), who proposed the \u201c**Liouville machine**\u201d for optimal control\u301042\u2020L129-L137\u3011. They pointed out that one can set up an optimal control problem as solving a transport equation in *state-action-time space*. They computed a joint density $\\rho(t,s,a)$ over time, state, and action, representing the probability of being in state $s$ at time $t$ and taking action $a$. The **Liouville\u2019s theorem** (conservation of phase space volume) implies that the conditional probability density must be constant along any trajectory in this extended space (with time increment $dt$, state increment $ds$, action increment $da$)\u301042\u2020L131-L137\u3011. By discretizing this transport equation, they obtained a large linear system whose solution gives an *optimal policy* \u2013 essentially the policy that makes the probability of reaching a designated goal state as high as possible\u301042\u2020L129-L137\u3011. Discount factors in RL translate to a decay term in the transport equation, which they handle by taking a Laplace transform of the time variable\u301042\u2020L133-L137\u3011. This work is notable for explicitly using the *continuity/transport equation as the starting point for RL*, rather than the Bellman equation. It leveraged the idea that if we conserve probability mass and direct it optimally toward a goal, we can solve control tasks by solving linear equations (at least for certain types of problems). While this approach can become intractable in very high dimensions, it offers a conceptually beautiful alternative view of RL: rather than value functions or Q-functions, one can work with *densities flowing through state-action space* (subject to Liouville\u2019s equation) to derive optimal policies\u301042\u2020L129-L137\u3011.\n\nAnother context where phase space **volume** and Liouville\u2019s theorem play a role is in understanding the effect of deterministic vs. stochastic dynamics. In a Hamiltonian system (energy-conserving, frictionless), Liouville\u2019s theorem tells us the phase space volume is preserved along trajectories \u2013 the flow is volume-preserving (incompressible) and there is no asymptotically stable point attractor because the system keeps orbiting. To get convergence to a goal (an attractor) in a physical control system, some dissipation or feedback that *reduces volume* (i.e. compresses trajectories together) is needed. A policy that introduces damping or energy loss effectively makes the divergence of the vector field negative in parts of the space, causing volumes to contract. In RL, when designing reward functions or model dynamics, one implicitly might be ensuring that the closed-loop system is dissipative (volume contracting) so that it will settle. The continuity equation with $\\nabla\\cdot(v\\mu)$ term illustrates this: if $\\nabla\\cdot v < 0$ in a region (volume contracting flow), the probability density $\\mu_t$ in that region will concentrate over time (trajectories converge). If $\\nabla\\cdot v = 0$ everywhere (volume preserving), the system is neutrally stable at best \u2013 typical of conservative dynamics without a clear attractor. Thus, from a theoretical standpoint, *phase space volume considerations* tell us about the kind of solutions RL agents can achieve. For instance, **symplectic or volume-preserving policies** (sometimes studied in model-based RL for physical systems) might be desirable for simulating physics accurately, but if the task requires convergence (like robotic arm reaching a target), the policy must induce volume loss (damping). This is consistent with control theory, where one often designs feedback that mimics damping to ensure a unique attractor at the desired equilibrium.\n\nFinally, considering flows and the continuity equation leads to insights about *occupancy measures* in RL. The **occupancy measure** of a policy is essentially the time-discounted (or time-averaged) distribution of state-action visits\u301028\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301028\u2020L31-L39\u3011. In theoretical analyses, the space of occupancy measures can be used to formulate RL as a linear program: maximize expected reward subject to linear flow constraints (which are discrete-time analogues of the continuity equation ensuring probability flux consistency). These constraints say: the occupancy of state $s$ equals the occupancy of predecessor states and actions that flow into $s$ (mass conservation in discrete time). Such formulations again highlight that at the heart of RL is **moving \u201cmass\u201d through a Markov chain** in an optimal way. The continuity equation is simply the differential form of those conservation laws. By solving for occupancy measures, one is implicitly solving a steady-state of the flow: in the optimal solution, the way probability mass flows through state-action space yields the maximal reward while obeying the dynamical constraints. This offers a very general, domain-agnostic perspective: an RL agent is essentially *routing probability density* through a graph (or continuous space) from initial states to goal states, and we can analyze this routing via flow equations.\n\n## Unifying Perspectives and Theoretical Insights  \nViewing reinforcement learning through the lens of dynamical systems yields several unifying insights:\n\n- **Unified Treatment of Learning and Control Dynamics:** The evolution of an RL agent\u2019s *knowledge* (parameters or value estimates) can be seen as a dynamical system, just as the environment\u2019s state evolution is. Stochastic approximation theory formalizes this: many RL algorithms (Q-learning, policy gradient, actor-critic) can be shown to follow an ODE in the limit of small step sizes. This ODE is often called the *mean dynamics* of the learning process. If this ODE has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium (a target attractor), one can prove the algorithm converges. Borkar\u2019s *Stochastic Approximation: A Dynamical Systems Viewpoint* (2008) laid out the general theory for treating update rules as flows on parameter space. For instance, temporal-difference learning with a linear function approximator corresponds to a linear ODE $\\dot{\\theta}=\u2026$ whose stability (eigenvalues negative) guarantees convergence of $\\theta_t$ to the fixed point solution. Conversely, if the ODE has a limit cycle or a chaotic attractor, the learning algorithm might not converge in the conventional sense. While most well-designed RL algorithms aim for convergent behavior, these tools explain, for example, why Q-learning can diverge with certain function approximations (the ODE is unstable) and why two-player adversarial training can cycle (the learning ODE corresponds to a rotating vector field with neutrally stable orbits). By bringing in Lyapunov stability analysis, one can sometimes design modifications to the algorithm to restore convergence (analogous to adding damping in a physical system).\n\n- **Stability vs. Optimality:** Dynamical systems analysis emphasizes stability (a concept of *dynamics*), whereas RL traditionally emphasizes optimality (a concept of *performance*). The two are not identical; a policy can be optimal but unstable (e.g. balancing at the top of a hill yields high reward until any disturbance causes failure). By applying dynamical systems tools, researchers have developed methods to ensure **stable optimal solutions**. Lyapunov functions, as discussed, enforce stability, and one can optimize reward subject to a Lyapunov constraint \u2013 bringing RL closer to **optimal control theory**, which always considers stability of the closed-loop. The emergence of \u201csafe RL\u201d as a subfield is essentially the injection of stability analysis into the RL optimization process\u301044\u2020L25-L33\u3011. This synthesis has led to algorithms that **monotonically improve a policy without ever destabilizing the system**, which is crucial for real-world agents that learn on the fly.\n\n- **Role of Chaos and Exploration:** Chaotic dynamics in the environment (or induced by the policy) have a two-sided effect. On one hand, chaos implies sensitivity and uncertainty, which an agent must contend with (robustness). On the other hand, a bit of chaotic behavior can aid exploration \u2013 chaotic trajectories cover state space broadly. There is a subtle viewpoint that an agent *itself* might harness controlled chaos to explore an environment efficiently. Some works (inspired by chaotic annealing or stochastic resonance ideas) explore adding chaotic noise to policies for better coverage of states. The formal notion of **Lyapunov exponent** gives a way to measure the \u201cspread\u201d of trajectories due to a policy, which might in the future guide algorithms that balance exploration (encourage divergence of trajectories to discover new states) with exploitation (eventually collapse onto the goal attractor). This remains speculative but represents a direction where dynamical systems theory (through concepts like attractor chaos, mixing rates, entropy of trajectories) could inform RL exploration strategies.\n\n- **Continuity Equation and Probability Flows:** The continuity equation viewpoint provides a **conservation law** perspective on RL: the agent is redistributing probability mass through the state space in order to accumulate reward in certain regions (e.g. near goal states). It highlights that an RL problem can be seen equally as (i) an optimal control problem (maximize reward along trajectories) and (ii) an optimal transport problem (push probability mass into high-reward states while obeying dynamics). In fact, recent formulations like *Stein Variational Policy Gradient* and *Flow-based Policy Optimization* make this explicit by directly updating an explicit state distribution via a flow field, rather than using value functions. These approaches leverage the mathematics of continuous flows to design RL algorithms that operate in the space of densities, which in some cases yields stronger theoretical guarantees (convergence in distribution)\u301020\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u301018\u2020L80-L87\u3011. \n\n- **Phase Space Geometry of Learned Agents:** Considering phase space volume and invariants gives a geometric understanding of what a learned agent is doing. For example, if an agent must conserve a quantity (like energy in a physical task), the optimal policy might be one that is *Hamiltonian* in certain phases (no energy loss when not needed) and *dissipative* when approaching the goal (to settle). An advanced theoretical viewpoint is to consider *contact Hamiltonian systems* for RL (incorporating dissipation into Hamiltonian mechanics) as a way to design energy-aware controllers. While not yet mainstream, ideas from geometric mechanics (symplectic integrators, volume-preserving maps) could influence how we design RL algorithms for physics environments, ensuring that learned policies respect fundamental physical conservation laws except where breaking them (through dissipation) is necessary for reaching a goal. \n\nIn conclusion, the fusion of dynamical systems theory with reinforcement learning has enriched our understanding and ability to design RL systems in several ways. It provides *mathematical formalisms* \u2013 Lyapunov functions for safety, ODEs for algorithm convergence, continuity equations for distribution evolution, Lyapunov exponents for chaos quantification \u2013 that allow us to analyze and guarantee the behavior of learning agents in **much deeper terms than reward alone**. By tracing ideas from early work on Lyapunov-stable learning agents\u301043\u2020L141-L149\u3011, through developments like the Liouville machine for optimal control\u301042\u2020L131-L137\u3011, to modern investigations of chaos in deep RL\u30101\u2020L33-L40\u3011, we see a clear trajectory: RL theory is increasingly embracing tools from dynamical systems to ensure that as agents get more powerful, their behavior remains *predictable, stable, and aligned with the designer\u2019s objectives*. This unifying perspective will likely continue to grow, leading to reinforcement learning methods that not only seek high reward, but do so with the rigorous guarantees and insights that only dynamical system theory can provide.\n\n**Sources:** The concepts and examples discussed are drawn from a broad literature integrating RL and dynamical systems, including Perkins & Barto\u2019s Lyapunov-safe learning\u301043\u2020L115-L123\u3011\u301043\u2020L141-L149\u3011, Berkenkamp *et al.*\u2019s stability-certified RL\u301044\u2020L25-L33\u3011, Young & Pugeault\u2019s chaos analysis in RL policies\u30101\u2020L33-L40\u3011\u30101\u2020L39-L47\u3011, Han *et al.*\u2019s Lyapunov-based chaos control via RL\u301026\u2020L74-L82\u3011\u301026\u2020L83-L84\u3011, and Kwee & Schmidhuber\u2019s Liouville machine for optimal control\u301042\u2020L129-L137\u3011, among other foundational works\u301018\u2020L80-L87\u3011\u301020\u2020L31-L34\u3011.

In this method, we design a reward function for the reinforcement learning according to the moving largest Lyapunov exponent, which is similar to the moving average but computes the corresponding largest Lyapunov exponent using a recently updated time series with a fixed, short length. We adopt the density peaks-based clustering algorithm to determine a linear region of the average divergence index so that we can obtain the largest Lyapunov exponent of the small data set by fitting the slope of the linear region. We show that the proposed method is",

In our experiments, we show how the resulting algorithm can safely optimize a neural network policy on a simulated",

We demonstrate that RL policies can be deterministically chaotic, as small perturbations to the system state have a large impact on subsequent state and reward trajectories. This unstable non-linear behaviour has two consequences: first, inaccuracies in sensor readings, or adversarial attacks, can cause significant performance degradation; second, even policies that show robust performance in terms of rewards may have unpredictable behaviour in",

These two facets of chaos in RL policies drastically restrict the application of deep RL to real-world problems. To address this issue, we propose an improvement on the successful Dreamer V3 architecture, implementing Maximal Lyapunov Exponent regularisation. This new approach reduces the chaotic state dynamics, rendering the learnt policies more resilient to sensor noise or adversarial attacks and thereby improving the suitability of deep reinforcement learning for real-world applications.",

In this method, we design a reward function for the reinforcement learning according to the moving largest Lyapunov exponent, which is similar to the moving average but computes the corresponding largest Lyapunov exponent using a recently updated time series with a fixed, short length. We adopt the density peaks-based clustering algorithm to determine a linear region of the average divergence index so that we can obtain the largest Lyapunov exponent of the small data set by fitting the slope of the linear region.
