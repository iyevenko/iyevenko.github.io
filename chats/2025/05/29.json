              "Think of the following\u2010-purely in the language of ordinary classical mechanics:\n\n1. **Pick a very large \u201cphase space.\u201d**  \n   Instead of the usual six coordinates (position and momentum of one particle) imagine one coordinate for every point of ordinary space: two real numbers per point, \\(q(\\mathbf r)\\) and \\(p(\\mathbf r)\\).  Altogether these coordinates form an infinite-dimensional phase space, just as the normal modes of a vibrating drum form an infinite collection of independent harmonic oscillators.\n\n2. **Choose a Hamiltonian.**  \n   Build an energy function \\(H[q,p]\\) that is quadratic in those coordinates\u2014precisely the same kind of quadratic form that describes coupled harmonic oscillators.  From that single scalar function you can write Hamilton\u2019s equations\n   \\[\n   \\dot q=\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p},\\qquad \n   \\dot p=-\\,\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q},\n   \\]\n   which are first-order, deterministic, time-reversible, and conserve the symplectic volume (Liouville\u2019s theorem)\u2014all the hallmarks of a standard classical flow.\n\n3. **Note what this flow *does*.**  \n   A single point \\((q,p)\\) in that giant phase space moves along a deterministic trajectory.  At each instant the energy \\(H\\) and every other constant of motion that Poisson-commutes with \\(H\\) is preserved.  In other words, mathematically nothing mysterious is happening: it is the completely classical picture of an incompressible, volume-preserving flow on a phase space.\n\n4. **Where does \u201cphysics\u201d enter?**  \n   In usual classical mechanics you treat the coordinates \\((q,p)\\) themselves as directly measurable.  Here you *don\u2019t*: the point \\((q,p)\\) serves only as a bookkeeping device.  To recover laboratory facts you need an *extra* prescription that tells you how to translate the location of that point into chances of seeing a table, an electron track, a photon click, and so on.  That translation rule does **not** follow from Hamilton\u2019s equations; it has to be appended by hand.\n\n5. **So, is it \u201cjust\u201d classical evolution?**  \n   - **Yes, regarding dynamics:** the time development is exactly a classical Hamiltonian flow on a phase space\u2014no randomness, no collapse, no loss of information.  \n   - **No, regarding observables:** in everyday classical mechanics the phase-space coordinates *are* the observables.  In this enlarged setting they are *not*; you still need an extra bridge between the evolving point and the outcomes of real experiments.  Without that bridge the formalism is only a mathematical clockwork.\n\nIn short, the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution can be re-expressed word-for-word as a perfectly ordinary Hamiltonian flow on an enormous phase space.  What makes it \u201cquantum\u201d (though we promised not to say that word!) is not the *motion* but the separate rule that ties the hidden coordinates \\((q,p)\\) to the things we actually observe."

Geometry by itself supplies the second item (a natural volume form); it does **not** supply the first.\n\n---\n\n### 2  The geometric part: a natural volume element  \nFor any system whose coordinates \\((q,p)\\) come from a Hamiltonian structure there is a canonical, dynamics-independent choice of volume:\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm dV \\;=\\;\\prod_i \\mathrm dq_i\\,\\mathrm dp_i .\n\\]\n\nThis \u201cLiouville\u201d volume is singled out by the symplectic geometry: it is preserved by every Hamiltonian flow and is unchanged by any canonical (symplectic) change of coordinates.  So the *measure* part is indeed purely geometric.\n\n---\n\n### 3  What geometry **cannot** give you  \n*Choosing* a density \\(\\rho\\) is a separate step.  \n\n* If you insist the system is exactly one point \\(z_0\\), then \\(\\rho(z)=\\delta(z-z_0)\\) and \\(h[\\rho] = -\\infty\\).  \n* If you take a uniform spread over some bounded region \\(\\Omega\\) of volume \\(V_\\Omega\\), then \\(\\rho=1/V_\\Omega\\) and \\(h=\\log V_\\Omega\\).  That numerical value changes as soon as you rescale the coordinates (centimeters \u2192 meters, electron-volts \u2192 joules), which shows that differential entropy cannot be a purely geometric invariant.  \n* If you want a quantity **independent** of coordinate scale, you must switch to *relative entropy* \\(D(\\rho\\Vert\\rho_\\text{ref})\\) or to coarse-grained or fractal notions such as information dimension.  Those are scale-invariant but, again, they all require a chosen density.\n\n---\n\n### 4  No dynamics needed\u2014but still a choice  \nYou asked to ignore evolution entirely.  That is fine; the formula for \\(h[\\rho]\\) never refers to time.  Yet you must still decide:\n\n1. **Which subset** of phase space is \u201cpossible.\u201d  \n2. **How densely** the system is supposed to populate that subset.\n\nUntil you do, \u201cthe entropy of *the* system\u201d is undefined.\n\n---\n\n### 5  Bottom line  \n*Geometry alone hands you a standard ruler (the Liouville volume).*  \n*Entropy also needs a mass-distribution on that ruler.*  \nTherefore differential entropy is **not** an inherent geometric property of the phase space itself; it is a property of a *probability assignment* you lay on top of that geometry."

While quantum terms like Wigner functions (quasi-probabilities) are useful, we'll stick to classical concepts and avoid operator-based explanations. Essentially, this perspective interprets it as defining a minimal measurable volume in phase space."

It limits how small the distribution's support can be, setting a minimal phase space area. While the principle suggests a lower bound on variance products, sets can be fractal, and illusions can arise. To approach this from a classical measure theory perspective, we treat position and momentum as random variables and explain that the product of their variances is constrained by uncertainty, using concepts like symplectic capacity for phase space."

Since they\u2019ve accepted the classical Hamiltonian perspective, I can stick with that. In simpler terms: for pure states, the probability distribution in phase space is delta-like, so the differential entropy is constant and stays at -\u221e. For ensembles, entropy is conserved because Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s evolution follows a Hamiltonian flow, which is measure-preserving. But when coarse-graining, entropy increases due to mixing, unless specific conditions are met."

The Schr\u00f6dinger equation was previously linked to classical Hamiltonian flow in the expanded phase space. While deterministic ODEs can describe individual phase-space states, physical states are about measurable quantities, and their evolution is governed by a Liouville PDE. This evolution applies to the ensemble-level density, but the ODE can still describe individual phase-space points. I'll further clarify this distinction."

I'll break this down by comparing phase space mappings of the two, showing that Schr\u00f6dinger has a \"special subclass\" of Hamiltonians.

              "### 1\u2003Same mathematical skeleton, but *very* special clothing  \n\n| Feature | General Hamiltonian mechanics | Schr\u00f6dinger equation seen as a Hamilton system |\n|---------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Phase-space point** | Coordinates have direct physical meaning: they are the positions and momenta of real particles or fields. | Coordinates are the *real and imaginary parts of the wave-profile* \\(c_k=(q_k+i p_k)/\\sqrt{2\\hbar}\\).  They are bookkeeping numbers, not macroscopic observables. |\n| **Hamiltonian \\(H\\)** | Arbitrary real function \\(H(q,p)\\).  Non-linearities of every order are allowed. | After the split \\(c\\!\\mapsto\\!(q,p)\\) the Hamiltonian is always **exactly quadratic**: \\(H=\\tfrac12 z^{\\!\\top}M z\\).  Consequently the flow it generates is *linear* in \\((q,p)\\). |\n| **Allowed trajectories** | Any volume-preserving flow on phase space. | A linear **unitary** flow: \\(z(t)=e^{tJ M}z(0)\\).  Thus the norm \\(\\sum(q_k^2+p_k^2)=2\\hbar\\) stays fixed; every trajectory lies on a sphere of radius \\(\\sqrt{2\\hbar}\\). |\n| **Redundancies** | Normally none: different points mean different physical states. | All points related by an overall phase (\\(q,p\\)\\(\\to\\)\\(q\\cos\\theta-p\\sin\\theta,\\; q\\sin\\theta+p\\cos\\theta\\)) represent the *same* physical situation.  That quotient (\u201cprojective\u2019\u2019 space) carries a natural metric of constant curvature. |\n| **Observables** | Any real function \\(A(q,p)\\); its time change is \\(\\dot A=\\{A,H\\}\\). | Only *quadratic* functions in \\((q,p)\\) correspond to measurable quantities.  Linear or higher-order functions have no direct physical interpretation. |\n| **Information limits** | Coordinates may be known with arbitrary precision; Liouville\u2019s theorem does not forbid delta-functions in both \\(q\\) and \\(p\\). | Pairs \\((q_k,p_k)\\) are conjugate: through \\((q,p)\\)=Re/Im they encode the usual \\(q\\)/\\(p\\) distributions, so their Fourier link imposes the Heisenberg-type spread. |\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003What fixes those special restrictions?\n\n1. **Linearity of dynamics.**  \n   The physical requirement that superpositions move to superpositions forces the generator to be linear on the complex amplitudes \\(c_k\\).  \n   Linearity on \\(c_k\\) *is* quadratic in \\((q,p)\\).\n\n2. **Norm preservation.**  \n   Probability must add to one; in the \\((q,p)\\) language that becomes conservation of the squared radius  \n   \\(\\sum(q_k^2+p_k^2)=2\\hbar\\).  \n   The only quadratic flows that leave that sphere invariant are generated by a *skew-symmetric* matrix \\(J M\\), i.e. they are symplectic **and** orthogonal\u2014hence unitary.\n\n3. **Phase gauge.**  \n   Multiplying every \\(c_k\\) by the same complex phase leaves all measurable probabilities unchanged.  \n   Quotienting by this \\(U(1)\\) symmetry turns the norm-one sphere into a curved manifold (complex projective space) on which the flow is still well defined; that curvature underlies interference and the uncertainty relations.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Why ordinary mechanics seldom looks like this\n\n* If you take a general Hamilton system and *linearise* it about an equilibrium, the small-oscillation dynamics is also quadratic and looks Schr\u00f6dinger-like\u2014but only near that equilibrium and without the gauge equivalence or fixed radius.  \n* The moment you include cubic or quartic terms, chaotic regions and dissipative structures appear; nothing like that shows up in a pure Schr\u00f6dinger flow because the quadratic restriction forbids all \u201cinteracting\u201d non-linearities in the \\((q,p)\\) variables themselves.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Measurement rule\u2014present in one, absent in the other\n\nBoth pictures so far are *closed*, deterministic, and time-reversible.  \nThe decisive extra ingredient that makes the \u201cquadratic Hamiltonian system\u201d a full-blown quantum theory is **how you read numbers from the evolving point**:\n\n* **Classical mechanics:** observe the phase-space coordinates directly.  \n* **Schr\u00f6dinger mechanics:** apply the separate Born rule to the *quadratic* observables (projectors), turning them into probabilities for detector clicks.\n\nThat **read-out map** has no analogue inside ordinary Hamiltonian mechanics.  It is where collapse, superposition tests, and all the empirical differences ultimately live.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Bottom line\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation *is* a Hamiltonian system, but a **highly constrained, quadratic, norm-preserving, gauge-identified, linear-flow** member of the family.  \nThose constraints make its mathematics look deceptively classical while ensuring its physical predictions remain distinct from any unconstrained Hamiltonian model of the same dimensionality."

Therefore the mapping \\(\\rho\\mapsto\\mathbf j\\) is *many-to-one*; \\(\\rho\\) alone never determines a unique current.  \n* **Interference:** when two wave packets overlap, \\(\\rho\\) at the meeting point comes from adding amplitudes, not densities.  The resulting \\(S\\) (hence \\(\\mathbf v\\)) is sensitive to their relative phase, so \\(\\mathbf v\\) can jump even where \\(\\rho\\) changes smoothly.  \n* **Topology:** vortices (where \\(S\\) winds by \\(2\\pi n\\)) force \\(\\mathbf v\\) to have quantised circulation and guarantee that no single-valued smooth velocity field exists on the whole domain.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2002Bottom line  \n\nYou *can* write  \n\\[\n\\mathbf j = \\rho\\,\\mathbf v,\n\\quad\\text{with}\\;\n\\mathbf v=\\nabla S/m,\n\\]\nbut \\(\\mathbf v\\) is encoded in\u2014and inseparable from\u2014the wave-function\u2019s phase.  The density \\(\\rho\\) by itself carries too little information to pin down a deterministic drift the way it does in classical mechanics or in a Fokker\u2013Planck description with prescribed drift \\(f\\).  That unavoidable dependence on hidden phase data is exactly what lets quantum ensembles exhibit interference and vortex phenomena that have no counterpart in an ordinary \u201c\\(\\rho f\\)\u201d flow."

Change the basis and you write a different list for the same physical situation. |\n| **\u201cComplex numbers\u2019\u2019** | Each entry is \\(a_k = r_k e^{i\\theta_k}\\).  The modulus \\(r_k\\) tells *how much* that possibility counts; the angle \\(\\theta_k\\) carries phase information that matters only when different possibilities are allowed to interfere. | The phase is what lets double-slit patterns, energy band gaps, etc., appear; the modulus alone would give you an ordinary probability distribution. |\n| **\u201cMutually exclusive possibilities\u2019\u2019** | Examples: \u201cparticle at position \\(x\\),\u2019\u2019 \u201cspin along \\(+z\\),\u2019\u2019 \u201coscillator in level \\(n\\).\u2019\u2019  Pick a complete set so that exactly one label is realised when you measure in that basis. | The wave-function is not tied to any one lab device: you may rewrite it in a new basis whenever you ask a different question. |\n| **\u201cSquared magnitudes add to 1\u2019\u2019** | \\(\\sum_k |a_k|^{2}=1\\) (or \\(\\int |a(x)|^{2}\\,dx=1\\) in the continuous case). | Guarantees that, when you finally look, the probabilities for all exclusive outcomes sum to 100 %. |\n\n---\n\n### Two concrete pictures\n\n1. **Discrete example (spin-\u00bd)**  \n   \\[\n     \\psi = \\bigl(a_{\\uparrow},\\,a_{\\downarrow}\\bigr),\n     \\qquad |a_{\\uparrow}|^{2}+|a_{\\downarrow}|^{2}=1.\n   \\]  \n   If you measure along \\(z\\), you see \u2191 with probability \\(|a_{\\uparrow}|^{2}\\) and \u2193 with \\(|a_{\\downarrow}|^{2}\\).\n\n2. **Continuous example (particle on a line)**  \n   \\[\n     \\psi(x),\\qquad \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\psi(x)|^{2}\\,dx = 1.\n   \\]  \n   Here the \u201clist\u2019\u2019 is an unbroken curve of complex amplitudes, one per position \\(x\\).

Its evolution law is the quantum-Liouville (Moyal) equation, not the simple continuity equation we derived for \\(\\rho\\).  \\(W\\) reduces to \\(\\rho\\) only after integrating over \\(\\mathbf p\\).\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003How \\(S\\) enters the dynamics  \n\nInsert the polar form of \\(\\Psi\\) into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation; separating real and imaginary parts gives two coupled PDEs:\n\n1. **Continuity**  \n   \\[\n   \\partial_t\\rho\\;+\\;\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\bigl(\\rho\\,\\frac{\\nabla S}{m}\\bigr)=0.\n   \\]\n2. **Quantum Hamilton\u2013Jacobi**  \n   \\[\n   \\partial_t S\n   +\\frac{(\\nabla S)^{2}}{2m}\n   +V\n   -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\,\n     \\frac{\\nabla^{2}\\sqrt{\\rho}}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}\n   =0.\n   \\]\n\nThe extra term containing \\(\\rho\\) is the **quantum potential**; it prevents the pair \\((\\rho,S)\\) from reducing to an ordinary Hamiltonian flow on classical phase space.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Analogy with classical phase-space densities  \n\n| Classical Liouville picture | Schr\u00f6dinger / Madelung picture |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Density \\(f(\\mathbf r,\\mathbf p,t)\\) lives on phase space and obeys \\(\\partial_t f + \\{f,H\\}=0\\). | Pair \\((\\rho(\\mathbf r,t),S(\\mathbf r,t))\\) lives on configuration space and obeys continuity + quantum-HJ. |\n| A *single* equation in \\(f\\) closes. | Two coupled equations: continuity for \\(\\rho\\) **needs** \\(S\\); the HJ-type equation for \\(S\\) **needs** \\(\\rho\\). |\n| No built-in uncertainty\u2014\\(\\delta(\\mathbf r-\\mathbf r_0)\\delta(\\mathbf p-\\mathbf p_0)\\) allowed. | Heisenberg bound emerges because \\(\\rho\\) and its Fourier partner (the momentum-space density) both derive from the *same* \\(\\Psi\\); they cannot be squeezed independently. |\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Take-away bullets  \n\n* \\(S(\\mathbf r,t)\\) is the **phase field in configuration space**; its gradient gives the local \u201cvelocity\u2019\u2019 that transports \\(\\rho\\).  \n* The gradient is **with respect to \\(\\mathbf r\\)**, not to an extended \\((\\mathbf r,\\mathbf p)\\).  \n* If you truly want a phase-space density, use the Wigner function; its dynamics is different and reduces to the classical Liouville equation only in the \\(\\hbar\\!\\to\\!0\\) limit.  \n* The pair \\((\\rho,S)\\) encodes the full wave-function; neither component alone is enough to reconstruct the future state.\n\nThat is why our earlier continuity equation sits in configuration space and why \\(S\\) cannot be swapped for a simple phase-space drift vector independent of the wave-function\u2019s hidden phase structure."

Similarly, the momentum marginal also evolves with its own continuity equation, but both marginals are linked through the full Wigner function. To obtain closure, we need more information beyond just the marginals, as both are tied via the complete wavefunction."

What remains is \\(|\\Psi(\\mathbf r,t)|^{2}\\) or \\(|\\widetilde\\Psi(\\mathbf p,t)|^{2}\\), both manifestly \u2265 0. |\n| **All \u201cquantum corrections\u2019\u2019 vanish when you integrate.** | Each extra term in the Moyal bracket contains an odd number of momentum (or position) derivatives.  After integrating over that variable it becomes a total divergence, and the boundary contribution at \\(\\pm\\infty\\) is zero (wave-functions are square-integrable).  Only the classical-looking first term survives. |\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003Resulting autonomous-looking equations\n\n**Position marginal**\n\nIntegrate the Moyal equation over \\(\\mathbf p\\):\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t\\rho\n+\\nabla_{\\mathbf r}\\!\\cdot\\mathbf j=0,\n\\quad\n\\mathbf j(\\mathbf r,t)=\\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\operatorname{Im}\\bigl(\\Psi^{*}\\nabla\\Psi\\bigr).\n\\tag{A}\n\\]\n\nNo higher-order \\(\\hbar\\)-corrections appear.\n\n---\n\n**Momentum marginal**\n\nIntegrate over \\(\\mathbf r\\) instead (and assume \\(V(\\mathbf r)\\) falls\noff so that surface terms vanish):\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t\\Pi\n-\\nabla_{\\mathbf p}\\!\\cdot\\bigl(\\mathbf F\\,\\Pi\\bigr)=0,\n\\quad\n\\mathbf F(\\mathbf p,t)\n=\\int\\!d^{3}r\\;\\bigl(-\\nabla_{\\mathbf r}V\\bigr)\\,\n             \\frac{W}{\\Pi}.\n\\tag{B}\n\\]\n\nFor a time-independent potential \\(V(\\mathbf r)\\) the rightmost integral\nreduces to the usual mean force, and again no higher-order\n\\(\\hbar\\)-series remains.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Do the marginals *really* evolve independently?\n\nOnly in appearance.  \nEach continuity-type law requires a **flux** term that cannot be\nexpressed with the marginal density alone:\n\n* In (A) you also need the current **\\(\\mathbf j\\)**, which contains the\n  *phase* \\(S\\) of the wave-function or, equivalently, off-diagonal\n  information from the full Wigner function.\n\n* In (B) you need the mean force **\\(\\mathbf F\\)**, which depends on the\n  joint distribution of \\(\\mathbf r\\) and \\(\\mathbf p\\); \\(\\Pi\\) on its\n  own is insufficient.\n\nPut differently:\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t\\rho\n\\;=\\;\n-\\nabla_{\\mathbf r}\\!\\cdot\\bigl(\\rho\\,\\mathbf v\\bigr)\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad\n\\mathbf v=\\nabla_{\\mathbf r}S/m,\n\\]\n\nand \\(S\\) is *not* recoverable from \\(\\rho\\) without extra\ninformation.  \nExactly the same hold-up occurs on the momentum side.\n\nSo the two marginals **share the same hidden degrees of\nfreedom** (the phase or, more generally, the off-diagonal sectors of\n\\(W\\)).  Knowing just one marginal never suffices to propagate it\nforward; you need either the full Wigner function or an\nequivalent set such as \\((\\rho,S)\\).\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Why the factorisation still works mathematically\n\nAlthough \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\Pi\\) cannot be evolved *separately*, the act of\n*integrating* the Moyal bracket produces closed-form conservation laws\nbecause every extra quantum correction is an **odd** total derivative\nin the variable you integrate out.  The algebra tells you\n\n* \u201cGlobal probability in \\( \\mathbf r\\)-space is conserved\u2019\u2019 and  \n* \u201cGlobal probability in \\( \\mathbf p\\)-space is conserved,\u2019\u2019\n\nirrespective of the detailed interference structure that couples the\ntwo spaces.  Those conserved currents are *unique* once the hidden\nphase (or Wigner off-diagonal terms) is fixed, but the continuity form\nof the equations is guaranteed by the antisymmetry of the Moyal\nbracket, not by independence of the marginals.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Take-home summary\n\n* **Why \u201cnicer\u201d ?**\u2003Integrating over one variable cancels every\n  higher-order \\( \\hbar\\)-term in the quantum Liouville equation,\n  leaving a first-order conservation law just like the classical one;\n  the resulting density is strictly non-negative.\n\n* **Why not truly independent?**\u2003Each continuity equation needs a flux\n  (\\(\\mathbf j\\) or \\(\\mathbf F\\)) that contains information lost in the\n  marginalisation.  The marginals look autonomous only after you supply\n  that extra data, which is encoded in the full Wigner function or in\n  the wave-function phase.\n\nSo the \u201cnice\u201d marginals inherit conservation-law structure from the\nantisymmetry of the Moyal bracket, but they do **not** decouple from\nthe full phase-space dynamics."

              "The picture you have in mind really is the one geometers use:  \nall three constant-curvature planes \u2013 spherical ( +1 ), Euclidean ( 0 ) and hyperbolic ( \u20131 ) \u2013 can be displayed **in the ordinary Euclidean plane just by multiplying the Euclidean metric by a suitable scale-factor**.  \nThat scale\u2013factor \u201cwarps\u2019\u2019 the horizontal and vertical directions differently, so a straight horizontal line in the Euclidean sense turns into something that, from the point of view of the new metric, occupies \u201cless than half\u2019\u2019 (hyperbolic) or \u201cmore than half\u2019\u2019 (spherical) of the full 360 \u00b0 around you.\n\n---\n\n### 1\u2003Start with the flat plane\n\nWrite the complex coordinate \\(z=x+iy\\) and give the plane its usual metric  \n\n\\[\nds_{0}^{2}=|dz|^{2}=dx^{2}+dy^{2}.\n\\]\n\nWith this metric a horizontal line \\(y=c\\) really does extend through *two* quadrants: it runs for ever to the left (\\(x\\to-\\infty\\)) and to the right (\\(x\\to+\\infty\\)).  \n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003Introduce a position-dependent scale factor\n\nChoose a smooth positive function \\( \\Omega(x,y) \\) and declare that distances are now measured with  \n\n\\[\nds^{2}=\\Omega(x,y)^{2}\\,ds_{0}^{2}.\n\\]\n\nBecause we have only *rescaled* lengths, angles are preserved; the change is purely in how far you have to walk to cover a given Euclidean length.\n\n| curvature \\(K\\) | convenient model | scale factor \\( \\Omega(x,y) \\) | name of the model |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n| \\(+1\\) | stereographic image of a sphere | \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) | spherical / \u201cpolar\u2019\u2019 |\n| \\(0\\) | \u2013 | 1 | Euclidean |\n| \\(-1\\) | Poincar\u00e9 upper half\u2013plane | \\(\\displaystyle \\frac1{y}\\) | hyperbolic |\n\nThose three choices give **constant Gauss curvature** \\(K=+1,0,-1\\) respectively.  \n(The sphere or the two-sheeted hyperboloid themselves carry those curvatures; the formulas above are just their canonical projections onto the plane.)\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003What happens to a horizontal line?\n\nTake the line \\(y=c\\) and ask how far it stretches in the new geometry.\n\n*Euclidean.*  \n\\(ds=dx\\); the integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx\\) diverges: the line is infinitely long and occupies 180 \u00b0 of your visual field (two quadrants).\n\n*Spherical.*  \n\\[\nds=\\frac{2}{1+x^{2}+c^{2}}\\;dx\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\text{length}=2\\Bigl(\\tan^{-1}x\\Bigr)\\Big|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}=2\\pi.\n\\]\nThe line has become a **closed geodesic of length \\(2\\pi\\)** \u2013 a great-circle seen via stereographic projection.  Walking straight on brings you right back to where you started, so it \u201cfills\u2019\u2019 the full 360 \u00b0 around you.\n\n*Hyperbolic.*  \n\\[\nds=\\frac{1}{c}\\,dx\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\text{length}=\\frac1c\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx=\\infty,\n\\]\nbut notice the *visual* effect: in the Poincar\u00e9 half-plane the boundary \\(y=0\\) is at **finite optical distance**, so the ideal endpoints of the line lie straight ahead of you \u2013 never behind.  Said another way, every horizontal line meets the ideal boundary in exactly *one* quadrant of your visual field.\n\n(Vertical lines or semicircles orthogonal to the boundary are the **geodesics** of the hyperbolic metric; a horizontal Euclidean line at \\(y=c\\) is *not* a geodesic, but the \u201cone-quadrant\u2019\u2019 intuition you noticed comes from how the ideal boundary shortens the visible angle.)\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003The conformal models tie everything together\n\nA single complex-analytic recipe produces all three geometries:\n\n\\[\nds_{K}^{2}=\\frac{4\\,|dz|^{2}}{(1+K|z|^{2})^{2}}\n\\quad\n\\begin{cases}\nK=+1 &\\text{(sphere)}\\\\\nK=0  &\\text{(Euclidean)}\\\\\nK=-1 &\\text{(hyperbolic\\ disk)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n* For \\(K=+1\\) one is looking at the sphere from its north pole (stereographic projection).  \n  Straight lines become circles that close up after \\(360^{\\circ}\\).\n\n* For \\(K=-1\\) one is looking at the two-sheeted hyperboloid from the origin of  \n  3-dimensional Minkowski space (projective or Poincar\u00e9 projection).  \n  Straight lines become Euclidean circles or diameters that meet the boundary of the disk twice; each end appears \u201cstraight ahead\u201d, so the line spans only a single quadrant.\n\nThe qualitative rule is simple:\n\n| curvature | what a straight line does when you walk on it |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| \\(+1\\)    | bends back, closes on itself (angle > 180\u00b0)   |\n| \\(0\\)     | stays straight, goes on for ever (angle = 180\u00b0) |\n| \\(-1\\)    | keeps diverging, never closes (angle < 180\u00b0)  |\n\nYour \u201cone-quadrant vs two-quadrant vs full-circle\u2019\u2019 observation is exactly this constant-curvature trichotomy viewed through the conformal pictures we usually draw on a sheet of paper."

              "# Dynamical Systems under Small Perturbations: Theoretical Studies\n\n## Noise-Induced Transitions and Nonequilibrium States\n\n- **Ruelle (1981)** \u2013 *\u201cSmall Random Perturbations of Dynamical Systems and the Definition of Attractors.\u201d* *Commun. Math. Phys.* **82**, 137 (1981). This foundational paper by David Ruelle re-examines the concept of attractors when a deterministic chaotic system is subjected to weak random perturbations. Ruelle proposes a new definition of attractors (inspired by Conley\u2019s ideas) that aligns with what is observed under small stochastic perturbations\u301019\u2020L43-L47\u3011. In essence, the paper argues that the \u201cstrange attractors\u201d seen in simulations and experiments (which always have some noise) correspond to measure-supported attractors under noisy dynamics. This work laid theoretical groundwork for understanding how invariant measures of chaotic systems are affected by infinitesimal noise.\n\n- **van den Broeck, Parrondo & Toral (1994)** \u2013 *\u201cNoise-Induced Nonequilibrium Phase Transition.\u201d* *Phys. Rev. Lett.* **73**, 3395 (1994). This influential study demonstrated that **multiplicative (state-dependent) noise** can qualitatively change a system\u2019s long-term behavior by inducing new stable states even when none exist deterministically. The authors used a stochastic model to show a genuine phase transition caused *solely by noise*: as the noise intensity passes a threshold, the system\u2019s stationary probability distribution shifts from unimodal to bimodal (breaking symmetry despite the deterministic dynamics being monostable). This nonequilibrium steady-state has no analog in the noise-free system, highlighting how state-dependent fluctuations can drive a system into new **non-equilibrium steady states (NESS)**. The analysis was done via the Fokker\u2013Planck equation and showed that detailed balance was broken, with a sustained probability current indicating a true NESS. This work is a cornerstone in **noise-induced transitions** theory, illustrating that noise can create or select new attractors (stable distributions) where deterministic dynamics had only one. (The general theory of such noise-induced phase transitions was further detailed in the monograph by Horsthemke & Lefever (1984), which provided a broader context for these phenomena.)\n\n- **Landa & McClintock (2000)** \u2013 *\u201cChanges in the Dynamical Behavior of Nonlinear Systems Induced by Noise.\u201d* *Phys. Reports* **323**, 1\u201380 (2000). This is a comprehensive review that surveys how **weak noise can have far-reaching effects** on nonlinear dynamical systems. The authors demonstrate through many examples and theory that even very small random perturbations can cause qualitative changes such as transitions to new states or attractors that are inaccessible in the purely deterministic system\u301018\u2020L1-L8\u3011. Topics covered include noise-induced transitions, stochastic resonance, and noise-modified bifurcations. Mathematically, they discuss the use of stochastic differential equations and their associated Fokker\u2013Planck formulations to compute stationary distributions and transition rates. A key insight is that multistable systems under small noise exhibit *metastability*: the system can hop between attractors, with noise determining the residence times (Kramers\u2019 escape rate theory is reviewed). This report solidified understanding that *noise is not merely a nuisance* but can fundamentally alter dynamical behavior, creating **new effective attractors or steady states** and even inducing chaos in some cases. It provided a unifying framework for phenomena like **noise-induced order** and **chaos stabilization/destruction by noise**, citing both theoretical results and consistent observations across physical and biological systems\u301018\u2020L1-L8\u3011.\n\n- **Kraut, Feudel & Grebogi (1999)** \u2013 *\u201cPreference of Attractors in Noisy Multistable Systems.\u201d* *Phys. Rev. E* **59**, 5253 (1999). This paper examines how a multistable deterministic system (one with several coexisting attractors) behaves under the influence of weak noise. Counterintuitively, the presence of noise can cause the system to **prefer** one attractor over others, even if all attractors are equally stable in the deterministic sense. The authors use a combination of simulation and Fokker\u2013Planck analysis to show that asymmetric probabilities of visiting each attractor arise from differences in basin geometry and the structure of invariant manifolds. Essentially, small random perturbations break the neutral \u201cselection\u201d of coexisting attractors and bias the stationary occupancy towards one attractor (often the one with the largest basin or with a nearby chaotic saddle). This work is theoretical but has implications for any noisy multistable system: it explains why one outcome may dominate in practice. It also highlights that a system\u2019s **invariant measure** under noise is concentrated around one attractor more than others, illustrating an information-theoretic idea that noise \u201cpicks\u201d the most accessible attractor. This study complements earlier results by providing quantitative measures of attractor preference and showing how to compute the stationary distribution over states in a multistable landscape via the FP equation.\n\n- **Kraut & Feudel (2002)** \u2013 *\u201cMultistability, Noise, and Attractor Hopping: The Crucial Role of Chaotic Saddles.\u201d* *Phys. Rev. E* **66**, 015207(R) (2002). Here, the authors delve into **noise-driven transitions** (\u201chopping\u201d) between attractors in a chaotic multistable system and discover that the mechanism hinges on *chaotic saddle* structures. By applying symbolic dynamics and numerical analysis, they found a sudden increase in dynamical entropy (randomness of trajectories) as a control parameter is varied under fixed noise\u301035\u2020L66-L74\u3011. This was explained by a novel bifurcation involving two chaotic saddles \u2013 essentially, noise allows trajectories to escape an attractor by briefly visiting an unstable chaotic saddle in the basin boundary, leading to a hop into a different attractor. They quantified how the **transient lifetimes** on these saddles follow a scaling law akin to the crisis-induced intermittency in chaos theory. The paper uses a Fokker\u2013Planck operator perturbative approach to estimate transition rates between attractors. The key contribution is the identification of a *geometric mechanism* for noise-induced attractor hopping: the presence of a chaotic saddle in phase space acts as a gateway for noise to push the system from one basin to another. This deepens the theoretical understanding of **noisy chaotic systems**, showing that even in fully chaotic regimes, small perturbations (noise) can exploit underlying saddle sets to produce qualitatively new behavior (intermittency, random hops). It bridges deterministic chaos theory with stochastic analysis by linking crisis bifurcations and FP escape-rate calculations.\n\n- **Forgoston & Moore (2018)** \u2013 *\u201cA Primer on Noise-Induced Transitions in Applied Dynamical Systems.\u201d* *SIAM Review* **60**(4), 969\u20131009 (2018). This article is a modern tutorial-style review that synthesizes the theory of **rare events and transitions in stochastic dynamical systems**. It is highly relevant as it emphasizes that even **weak noise can induce large changes** in system behavior, such as escapes from a quasi-stable state or switches between metastable attractors\u301023\u2020L65-L73\u3011. The authors outline the mathematics of stochastic processes (using SDEs with state-dependent noise), the Fokker\u2013Planck equation for evolving probability densities, and especially the **Wentzell\u2013Freidlin large deviation theory** for estimating transition paths and rates. They discuss how to compute **quasi-potential landscapes** for non-gradient systems, which generalize the notion of an energy landscape in nonequilibrium settings. Non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) are highlighted in the context of probability currents: the primer shows how detailed balance is broken in systems with state-dependent perturbations and how that leads to persistent probability fluxes in steady state. The review also connects to information theory by discussing entropy-like Lyapunov functions for the FP equation (e.g. relative entropy decay). Overall, this primer provides a technically detailed yet accessible summary of how small random perturbations produce *tipping events* in dynamical systems, with methods to analyze these events (action minimization, FP eigenfunctions, etc.). It solidifies concepts with examples, making it clear how **noise both creates and destroys attractors** in a controlled fashion\u301023\u2020L65-L73\u3011.\n\n## Controlling Chaos and Multistability with Small Perturbations\n\n- **Pisarchik & Feudel (2014)** \u2013 *\u201cControl of Multistability.\u201d* *Physics Reports* **540**, 167\u2013218 (2014). This is an extensive theoretical review of methods to control multistable dynamical systems, i.e. systems with coexisting attractors. A major theme is the use of **small perturbations as control signals** to navigate between different attractors or eliminate undesired ones. The paper covers both feedback and non-feedback (open-loop) control strategies. Notably, it discusses *weak periodic or stochastic perturbations* that can destabilize certain attractors and drive the system into a desired state. For example, applying carefully timed small kicks or noise pulses can induce *attractor switching*. The authors point out that multistable systems are **extremely sensitive to tiny perturbations**, which is a challenge but also an opportunity for control\u301027\u2020L37-L40\u3011\u301027\u2020L19-L27\u3011. They review techniques like short pulses for attractor selection, harmonic perturbations to annihilate specific attractors, and noise-induced switching for favoring a desired attractor (sometimes called \u201cstochastic control\u201d). The article also surveys theoretical tools \u2013 including Fokker\u2013Planck descriptions for stochastic perturbations \u2013 to predict the outcome of a control intervention. A key insight is that because each attractor corresponds to a distinct system performance, being able to induce transitions with minimal perturbation energy has high value. This work is **purely theoretical** (though motivated by applications) and consolidates knowledge on how **tiny controls can achieve large changes** in a system\u2019s long-term behavior. It emphasizes that any small external perturbation (even incidental noise) may switch the system from one attractor to another, fundamentally changing the dynamics\u301027\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Controlling multistability is thus presented as a feasible task by exploiting the inherent sensitivity of nonlinear systems.\n\n- **Ott, Grebogi & Yorke (1990)** \u2013 *\u201cControlling Chaos.\u201d* *Phys. Rev. Lett.* **64**, 1196 (1990). Although not focused on stochastic noise, this classic theoretical paper introduced the idea that a chaotic system\u2019s behavior can be controlled and stabilized onto a desired trajectory by the application of arbitrarily small perturbations. The OGY method treats slight parameter variations or tiny kicks as control signals that leverage the system\u2019s natural dynamics to guide it to an existing unstable periodic orbit (a new attractor in practical terms). The relevance here is conceptual: it showed that **dissipative chaotic systems** can be tamed with minimal intervention, highlighting the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters as a tool rather than a hindrance. The method relies on linearizing the Poincar\u00e9 map near the target orbit and making minute adjustments when the trajectory passes close by. OGY\u2019s success sparked a whole subfield of chaos control. While it does not involve SDEs or Fokker\u2013Planck equations, it is a theoretical cornerstone in treating *perturbations as control signals* in dynamical systems. The paper demonstrated that a chaotic attractor can be converted into a regular (periodic) attractor by **tiny deterministic perturbations**, thereby changing the system\u2019s qualitative dynamics with virtually no energy cost. This result complements stochastic approaches by suggesting that even in the absence of noise, one can impose small controlled perturbations to achieve a similar effect \u2013 driving the system to a different attractor (e.g. stabilizing an otherwise unreachable steady state or cycle). OGY is a purely theoretical development with profound implications for how we understand stability and control in nonlinear systems.\n\n*(**Note:** The Ott\u2013Grebogi\u2013Yorke method above is deterministic; it\u2019s included here to illustrate the concept of small control perturbations in chaos. The rest of the listed works focus on stochastic perturbations and Fokker\u2013Planck analysis.)*\n\n## Fokker\u2013Planck in Information-Theoretic and Control Contexts\n\n- **Wibisono, Jog & Loh (2017)** \u2013 *\u201cInformation and Estimation in Fokker\u2013Planck Channels.\u201d* (Proc. IEEE ISIT 2017; arXiv:1702.03656). This theoretical paper recasts a general stochastic dynamical system as an information-theoretic communication channel (the \u201cFokker\u2013Planck channel\u201d). The authors consider a state-dependent SDE $dX_t = a(X_t)dt + \\sigma(X_t)dW_t$ and derive how **entropy** and **information measures** evolve in time according to the Fokker\u2013Planck equation governing $p(x,t)$. They show that the time-derivatives of Shannon entropy, Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, and mutual information for the state distribution can be *exactly expressed* in terms of generalized Fisher information metrics\u301032\u2020L1-L4\u3011. This extends classical information identities (De Bruijn\u2019s identity and the I-MMSE relation) to the case of state-dependent diffusion (multiplicative noise). One key result is that while entropy itself need not increase monotonically in such processes, the relative entropy between two solutions of the FP equation decays at a rate given by a \u201crelative Fisher information\u201d\u301032\u2020L49-L57\u3011\u301032\u2020L61-L69\u3011. In practical terms, this means any **perturbation** that steers the system\u2019s distribution (thought of as a control signal) can be linked to an information cost (via Fisher info), and the Fokker\u2013Planck framework provides a rigorous way to quantify the \u201cinformation flow\u201d in the dynamics. Though not about attractors per se, this work is valuable in an **information-theoretic view of nonequilibrium systems**, particularly highlighting how state-dependent noise influences entropy and information transfer. It merges stochastic control intuition with estimation theory, indicating how small control perturbations might be optimally designed by looking at information gain or dissipation in the Fokker\u2013Planck evolution\u301032\u2020L1-L4\u3011.\n\n- **Annunziato & Borz\u00ec (2018)** \u2013 *\u201cA Fokker\u2013Planck Control Framework for Stochastic Systems.\u201d* *EMS Surveys in Math. Sciences* **5**(1), 65\u201398 (2018). This article presents a formal framework for **optimal control of the probability density** of stochastic dynamical systems using the Fokker\u2013Planck equation. Instead of controlling individual trajectories, the goal is to design a control input (a small perturbing force or parameter variation) that steers the whole probability distribution $p(x,t)$ to a desired target distribution or along a desired evolution. The authors formulate the control problem as an optimization problem with the FP equation as a constraint. They show that many stochastic control problems can be recast as **deterministic PDE control** problems on the FP equation\u301021\u2020L5-L13\u3011\u301021\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Under small control signals, linearization is possible and the connection to the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman (HJB) equation of classical control is elucidated \u2013 in fact, they prove an equivalence between this FP control approach and the HJB dynamic programming approach under certain assumptions\u301021\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Technically, they handle cases of state-dependent diffusion (including fractional diffusion and jump processes), thus encompassing a wide range of SDEs. The paper is rich in mathematical detail: it derives gradient formulas for the control of the FP equation and discusses numerical methods. For the context of this query, the significance is that it treats *perturbations explicitly as control signals* applied to SDEs and uses the Fokker\u2013Planck formalism to predict how those signals drive the system into new steady distributions or transient behaviors. It\u2019s a purely theoretical development that bridges stochastic dynamics with control theory, reinforcing that **small inputs can be designed to produce big changes** in the system\u2019s probabilistic behavior by exploiting the FP dynamics\u301021\u2020L5-L13\u3011.\n\n- **Kappen (2005)** \u2013 *\u201cPath Integrals and Symmetry Breaking for Optimal Control Theory.\u201d* *Phys. Rev. Lett.* **95**, 200201 (2005). In this theoretical paper, H.J. Kappen reformulates certain nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems as path integrals, linking them to statistical mechanics. While the focus is on solving control problems, one notable finding is the existence of a **critical noise intensity** above which the structure of the optimal control solution qualitatively changes (a form of symmetry breaking in the control cost landscape). This hints that small vs. large perturbation regimes can lead to fundamentally different dynamical outcomes \u2013 effectively, noise can *assist* control. The path-integral approach leads to a **linear Fokker\u2013Planck equation** (or Schr\u00f6dinger-type equation) for the controlled probability density, making the control problem analytically tractable. For example, controlling a double-well system to switch wells is easier when a moderate amount of noise is present, as the noise helps overcome the barrier (an insight consistent with noise-induced transition theory). Kappen\u2019s work, though framed in terms of optimal control, provides another perspective on how **stochastic perturbations** can be harnessed to drive systems between attractors. It shows that introducing or increasing noise can *lower the control effort* needed to reach a new attractor (since noise itself provides energy to escape basins), a concept with parallels in the idea of \u201cstochastic resonance\u201d and \u201cnoise-enabled control.\u201d This paper is entirely theoretical and contributes to the information-theoretic understanding of controlled diffusions by showing how control objectives can be met by tuning noise and using FP path-integral solutions, rather than fighting against noise.\n\n## Recent Advances with State-Dependent Noise\n\n- **Phillips, Lindner & Kantz (2025)** \u2013 *\u201cStabilizing Role of Multiplicative Noise in Nonconfining Potentials.\u201d* *Phys. Rev. Research* **7**, 023146 (2025). This very recent theoretical work examines a striking effect: adding *parametric noise* (noise whose intensity depends on state) to a system that lacks a confining potential can actually induce **stability and new steady states**. The authors develop a perturbative framework (using scale parameter expansions) for SDEs with multiplicative noise and show that increasing the noise intensity causes the stationary probability distribution to concentrate around certain state values (specifically, the minima of the noise coefficient function)\u301044\u2020L45-L53\u3011. In other words, the noise itself creates effective \u201cpotential wells\u201d that were absent in the deterministic system, thus **stabilizing the dynamics around new attractors**. However, due to the stochasticity, the system also exhibits burst-like intermittent jumps between these noise-created attractors (when multiple minima exist), akin to on-off intermittency if one of the minima corresponds to a zero noise amplitude\u301044\u2020L49-L57\u3011. The paper uses the Fokker\u2013Planck equation to quantify the stationary distribution\u2019s shape (introducing measures like full-width-half-maximum since mean and variance may be infinite for heavy-tailed cases). One practical example discussed is a particle in a *flat* or double-well potential: without noise it might drift unbounded or wander, but multiplicative noise can pin the particle around certain locations and produce a quasistationary distribution. This counterintuitive **noise-induced stabilization** is deeply theoretical; it highlights how state-dependent perturbations can give rise to **non-equilibrium steady states** where entropy production does not vanish (a hallmark of NESS). The results connect to tipping-point analysis in climate and other fields by suggesting that noise could prevent a system from tipping by creating a temporary stabilizing basin. This study underscores that small stochastic perturbations, if of the right form, can fundamentally alter the phase-space structure of a system, imposing new attractors where none existed deterministically\u301044\u2020L45-L53\u3011\u301044\u2020L49-L57\u3011.\n\n- **Abril-Berm\u00fadez *et al.* (2025)** \u2013 *\u201cPath Integral for Multiplicative Noise: Generalized Fokker\u2013Planck Equation and Entropy Production Rate in Stochastic Processes with Threshold.\u201d* *Phys. Rev. Research* **7**, 023185 (2025). This advanced theoretical paper extends the path-integral formalism for SDEs with arbitrary state-dependent noise, addressing mathematical subtleties in defining path integrals for multiplicative noise. By carefully treating the Jacobian (using a Parisi\u2013Sourlas approach) and incorporating a cumulant-generating functional for the noise, the authors derive a **generalized Fokker\u2013Planck equation** that remains valid even when standard FP equations would involve higher-order derivatives or ambiguity. They then apply the formalism to examples like Brownian motion with reflecting thresholds and geometric Brownian motion, computing analytical expressions for the **probability density, Shannon entropy, and entropy production rate** in the stationary state\u301038\u2020L139-L147\u3011\u301038\u2020L144-L152\u3011. One notable result is that for processes like restricted (bounded) Brownian motion or geometric Brownian motion, a true equilibrium (with zero entropy production) is never reached \u2013 instead these systems settle into a **quasi-steady state** with ongoing entropy production\u301038\u2020L144-L152\u3011. This indicates a NESS maintained by the multiplicative noise. The paper thus links **information-theoretic quantities** (entropy and its production) with the Fokker\u2013Planck description of state-dependent noisy dynamics. It provides a rigorous way to calculate how small perturbations (especially those with thresholds or state-dependent switching) drive the system away from equilibrium. In summary, Abril-Berm\u00fadez *et al.* give a cutting-edge theoretical toolkit for analyzing SDEs with multiplicative noise, and they show explicitly how such noise can generate complex steady-state behavior accompanied by continuous information/entropy flow in the system. This contributes to both the mathematical theory of FP equations and the physical understanding of **how state-dependent fluctuations create and sustain nonequilibrium steady states**\u301038\u2020L139-L147\u3011\u301038\u2020L144-L152\u3011.\n\nEach of the above papers provides a **theoretical insight** into how small perturbations (modeled as noise or control inputs) can dramatically influence dynamical systems. They collectively cover the emergence of new attractors or steady distributions due to noise, methods to control or exploit these perturbations, and the use of the Fokker\u2013Planck formalism (often coupled with information theory) to analyze the effects. All results are obtained analytically or through mathematical analysis of models, emphasizing general principles rather than specific experimental systems. The unifying theme is that **tiny inputs can produce qualitative changes** in system behavior, whether by inducing transitions between existing attractors, creating new effective attractors, or optimizing certain behaviors, and the Fokker\u2013Planck equation is a crucial tool in quantifying these changes. \n\n"

If the multiplicative noise term has one zero this causes on-off intermittency. Our framework relies on first term expansions, which become more accurate for larger noise intensities. In this work we show that the full width half maximum in addition to the maximum is appropriate for quantifying the stationary probability distribution (instead of the mean and variance, which are often undefined). We define a corresponding new kind of weak sense stationarity. We consider a double well potential as an",
