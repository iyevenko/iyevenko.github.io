When discussing fractal attractors, it\u2019s important to clarify that p(x|m), as a full probability distribution, doesn\u2019t describe just trajectories. Stationarity refers to the ensemble state, not a single path. In dissipative systems, there can still be an invariant steady-state distribution, even when density becomes singular.

              "### 1 \u00b7 Which \u201ctime\u2013derivative\u201d is being set to zero?\n\nThe Fokker\u2013Planck (FP) equation is **Eulerian**:  \n\\[\n\\partial_t p(x,t)=\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!\\bigl(\\Gamma\\nabla p-fp\\bigr)\n\\]\ndescribes how an *ensemble* density \\(p(\\,\\cdot\\,,t)\\) changes at each fixed point \\(x\\) of state-space.  \nThe quantity whose derivative you see Friston set to zero is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\partial_t p(x,t)\\;}\n\\]\n\n\u2014not the logarithmic density measured **along one trajectory**.  \nIf you \u201cride\u201d on a single sample path \\(x(t)\\) (the **Lagrangian** viewpoint) the quantity that changes exponentially is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dt}\\ln p\\bigl(x(t),t\\bigr)=-\\nabla\\!\\cdot f\\bigl(x(t)\\bigr)+\\text{noise\\ corrections},\n\\]\n\nand that may indeed diverge on a dissipative (fractal) attractor.  \nBut that Lagrangian object is *not* the integrand of the FP equation.  \n\n---\n\n### 2 \u00b7 Why is it legitimate to look for \\(\\partial_t p=0\\)?\n\nA solution of \\(\\partial_t p=0\\) is an **invariant (stationary) distribution** \\(p_\\infty\\):\n\n\\[\n\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!\\bigl(\\Gamma\\nabla p_\\infty-fp_\\infty\\bigr)=0 .\n\\]\n\nThis plays two roles:\n\n* **Physics / stochastic processes** \u2013 If the SDE with drift \\(f\\) and diffusion \\(\\Gamma\\) is *ergodic*, \\(p(x,t)\\to p_\\infty(x)\\) as \\(t\\to\\infty\\).  One therefore *calculates* \\(f\\) by requiring a chosen target density to be invariant.\n\n* **Free-energy principle / active inference** \u2013 The slides invert the usual order: starting from a *desired* stationary density (agent\u2019s \u201cbeliefs\u201d), they **solve for the drift**  \n  \\[\n  f=(\\Gamma-Q)\\,\\nabla\\ln p_\\infty\n  \\]\n  such that the FP equation will keep that density fixed.  Setting \\(\\partial_t p=0\\) is not saying the world is at equilibrium now; it is the *design equation* that guarantees the agent\u2019s dynamics make the density an attractor.\n\n---\n\n### 3 \u00b7 What about fractal attractors and singular measures?\n\n* **Deterministic, noise-free flow** (\\(\\Gamma=0\\)):  \n  The FP equation reduces to the Liouville equation  \n  \\(\\partial_t p=-\\nabla\\!\\cdot(fp)\\).  \n  For a dissipative system \\(p(x,t)\\) contracts onto a lower-dimensional set; in the limit one obtains an **SRB measure** supported on the fractal attractor.  It is *still* a stationary distribution: once all probability mass sits on the attractor, the Liouville operator cannot move it off.\n\n* **Non-zero diffusion** (\\(\\Gamma\\succ0\\)):  \n  Diffusion regularises the measure; under mild conditions there is a unique, smooth \\(p_\\infty\\).  The contraction produced by negative divergence is exactly balanced by the outward diffusive flux.  Ergo \\(\\partial_t p_\\infty=0\\).\n\nEither way, \u201cstationary\u201d refers to the **ensemble** balance of fluxes, not to the pointwise stretching/compression you see when following an individual path.\n\n---\n\n### 4 \u00b7 Connecting back to the slide\n\nThe bottom line on the slide\n\n\\[\nf=(\\Gamma-Q)\\nabla\\ln p\n\\]\n\nis derived by **imposing stationarity** (\\(\\partial_t p=0\\)) and performing a Helmholtz decomposition of the probability current:\n\n\\[\nJ = fp-\\Gamma\\nabla p\n    = p(\\Gamma\\nabla\\ln p) - p\\,Q\\nabla\\ln p .\n\\]\n\n* The symmetric piece \\(\\Gamma\\nabla\\ln p\\) is a **gradient flow** that dissipates free energy.  \n* The antisymmetric piece \\(-Q\\nabla\\ln p\\) is **divergence-free**, giving rotational motion on iso-probability surfaces.\n\nBecause \\(Q\\) is antisymmetric, \\(\\nabla\\!\\cdot(Q\\nabla p)=0\\), so \\(J\\) is divergence-free and the continuity equation is satisfied with \\(\\partial_t p=0\\).  Setting that derivative to zero is therefore exactly the condition that ties \\(f\\) to the chosen \\(p\\); it is not an empirical claim that densities never evolve, but a *constraint* that picks out the drifts for which the chosen density is an attractor.\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom line\nYou are free to analyse time-dependent solutions of the FP equation, and for dissipative deterministic flows the density along a single trajectory can indeed blow up.  Friston\u2019s step \\(\\partial_t p=0\\) is simply the standard way of **characterising invariant measures**\u2014in his context, the agent\u2019s \u201cpreferred\u201d beliefs\u2014and of finding the dynamics that will make those measures stable."

In the context of the Fokker-Planck equation, it often remains constant, particularly in isotropic systems but may vary depending on state. Q is an antisymmetric matrix from the Helmholtz decomposition, which encodes non-dissipative dynamics and governs solenoidal flow. It is constant and very much tied to the curl component of the system."

In dissipative situations one needs the \u0393\u2207ln p term (or some other compressive mechanism) to balance contraction and secure both existence *and* attractivity of a smooth stationary density."

The FP/Liouville equation and the identity \\(\\nabla\\!\\cdot(Q\\nabla p)=0\\) still hold in the sense of distributions because:\n\n1. \\(Q\\) is constant, so it commutes with distributional derivatives.\n2. Distributional second derivatives coincide (mixed partials commute) whenever both exist as distributions.\n\nHence the antisymmetric-times-symmetric cancellation remains valid.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The Hessian of \\(p\\) is symmetric whenever \\(p\\) has continuous second partial derivatives, which is the regularity tacitly assumed in the slide-level treatment.  The same symmetry property extends, in the weak (distributional) sense, to less regular densities, so the argument does not require the restrictive condition \\(\\Delta p=0\\)."

The rotational component is driven by the probability current, which is orthogonal to the gradient. Since the gradient (related to D u) is symmetric, the antisymmetric part depends only on f. So Q is independent of D unless f itself changes with D. In scenarios where f depends on D, Q might be sensitive to D, but otherwise, it remains unaffected."

              "# Karl Friston\u2019s Free Energy Principle: Foundations, Development, and Applications\n\n## Mathematical Foundations of the Free Energy Principle\n\nThe **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** is a framework that describes how self-organizing systems (like the brain or an organism) maintain their order by minimizing a quantity called *variational free energy*. In essence, the FEP formalizes the idea that systems avoid surprising states by acting as Bayesian inference machines\u301013\u2020L167-L175\u3011\u301018\u2020L236-L243\u3011. *Surprise* (or **surprisal**) in this context is the negative log-probability of an outcome under the system\u2019s internal model (also known as self-information). The long-term average of surprise is entropy, so keeping surprise low means keeping sensory entropy low\u301025\u2020L43-L52\u3011\u301025\u2020L61-L69\u3011. Because a system cannot directly evaluate surprise (it would need to know the true probabilities of all outcomes), it instead minimizes *free energy*, a computable proxy that **upper-bounds surprise**\u301018\u2020L245-L249\u3011. By minimizing this variational free energy, the system implicitly minimizes the unexpectedness (surprise) of its sensory states\u301018\u2020L245-L249\u3011\u301016\u2020L19-L23\u3011.\n\nMathematically, *variational free energy* $F$ is defined in the setting of a generative model and a recognition density (the system\u2019s internal *belief* about the hidden causes of observations). The free energy can be expressed as: \n\n\\[F(q, o) = \\underbrace{D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(q(z)\\,\\|\\,p(z|o))}_{\\text{KL divergence}} - \\ln p(o),\\] \n\nwhich rearranges to $F = \\ln p(o) - \\mathcal{L}$, where $\\mathcal{L} = -D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(q(z)\\,\\|\\,p(z|o))$ is the evidence lower bound (ELBO). In words, $F$ is the difference between *surprise* ($-\\ln p(o)$, also called negative log model evidence) and an information gain term. Minimizing $F$ thus increases the ELBO, tightening the bound on surprise\u301018\u2020L236-L243\u3011\u301018\u2020L269-L271\u3011. In effect, **free energy is an upper bound on surprise**\u301018\u2020L245-L249\u3011: when the internal *recognition density* $q(z)$ (the system\u2019s beliefs about hidden causes $z$) matches the true posterior $p(z|o)$, free energy equals surprise exactly and is minimized. By performing gradient descent on free energy, a system updates its internal beliefs $q(z)$ to approximate the Bayesian posterior, implementing *variational Bayesian inference*\u301018\u2020L236-L243\u3011. This is why the FEP is often described as a formal connection to Bayesian inference: *perception* becomes approximate Bayesian inference that *explains away* sensory inputs by updating internal beliefs to reduce prediction error (surprise). Indeed, minimizing free energy can be seen as maximizing Bayesian **model evidence** for the organism\u2019s internal model of the world\u301018\u2020L236-L243\u3011.\n\nA consequence of this formulation is that *negative free energy* is equivalent to the log evidence lower bound widely used in machine learning. For example, the training of **variational autoencoders** and other generative models relies on maximizing the ELBO, which corresponds to minimizing variational free energy\u301018\u2020L269-L271\u3011. This tight connection means the FEP leverages the same mathematics as variational inference in statistics and machine learning, providing a bridge between brain theory and modern probabilistic learning techniques.\n\nIn summary, the mathematical core of FEP asserts that any agent can be seen as continually updating a probabilistic **generative model** of its environment to minimize a free-energy functional. By doing so, the agent implicitly bounds the *surprise* it experiences\u301018\u2020L245-L249\u3011 and thereby maintains its internal states within viable bounds (a principle of homeostasis or autopoiesis). Crucially, this free-energy minimization underlies both perceiving the world (updating beliefs to better predict sensory inputs) and acting on the world (choosing actions that make sensory inputs conform to predictions), as we discuss next\u301013\u2020L186-L194\u3011\u301018\u2020L236-L243\u3011.\n\n## Historical Development and Theoretical Roots\n\nThe Free Energy Principle did not emerge in isolation; it synthesizes ideas from **19th-century physiology, mid-20th-century cybernetics, and late-20th-century neuroscience and machine learning**. A key historical root is **Hermann von Helmholtz**\u2019s concept of *unconscious inference* (circa 1860s), which proposed that perception is fundamentally a process of inferring the causes of sensory inputs\u301018\u2020L232-L240\u3011. In modern terms, Helmholtz viewed the brain as a prediction machine that interprets incoming sensations by invoking internal hypotheses about the world. This idea \u2013 that perception is *Helmholtzian inference* \u2013 directly inspired later theories of the \u201cBayesian brain.\u201d In fact, the FEP explicitly builds on Helmholtz\u2019s work, casting perception as *inferring hidden causes* of sensory data via a generative model\u301018\u2020L232-L239\u3011.\n\nFast-forward to the late 20th century, and we find parallel developments in **machine learning** and theoretical neuroscience that set the stage for FEP. One milestone was the *Helmholtz Machine* (Dayan, Hinton et al., 1995), an unsupervised learning model that introduced a \u201cwake-sleep\u201d algorithm for training deep generative networks. The Helmholtz Machine was an early implementation of variational inference in neural networks, explicitly invoking two networks \u2013 one generating data and one recognizing causes \u2013 much like the generative and recognition densities in FEP\u301018\u2020L232-L240\u3011\u301017\u2020L31-L34\u3011. This machine-learning innovation demonstrated how an agent could *learn* a model of its environment by minimizing an error measure, foreshadowing the variational free-energy minimization later formalized by Friston. As one review succinctly puts it, the theory of the FEP *\u201ccombines insights from Helmholtzian \u2018perception as inference\u2019, machine learning theory, and statistical thermodynamics.\u201d*\u30107\u2020L54-L63\u3011 In other words, FEP sits at the nexus of ideas from **Helmholtz**, **Bayesian brain hypotheses**, **predictive coding**, and even principles from **thermodynamics** and **information theory** (like entropy minimization and the principle of least action\u301018\u2020L255-L264\u3011).\n\nAnother direct precursor to FEP is the **predictive coding** paradigm in neuroscience. In the 1990s and 2000s, researchers (Rao & Ballard, 1999; Mumford, 1992; and later Friston, 2005) proposed that the cortex is fundamentally implementing a hierarchical predictive coding scheme. In predictive coding models, each level of a cortical hierarchy generates predictions of activity in the level below, and what is passed upward are *prediction errors* \u2013 the differences between expected input and actual input. This aligns with a principle of minimizing prediction errors throughout the hierarchy. Friston\u2019s work in 2005 (\u201cA theory of cortical responses\u201d) recast cortical circuits in these terms, suggesting that neurons encode predictions and errors as part of a Bayesian inference scheme. Under the FEP, **predictive coding emerges as a process theory** for implementing free-energy minimization in the brain\u301019\u2020L13-L21\u3011. Specifically, in a hierarchical setting the brain can minimize free energy by recurrently exchanging **ascending prediction errors** and **descending predictions**, which is exactly the dynamic posited by predictive coding models\u301019\u2020L13-L17\u3011. Furthermore, adjusting synaptic weights to minimize free energy corresponds to **Hebbian learning rules** (associative plasticity) in these models\u301019\u2020L19-L27\u3011. In short, predictive coding provided a mechanistic explanation \u2013 grounded in neural circuitry \u2013 for how Bayes-optimal inference (approximately minimizing free energy) might be achieved by real neurons. This convergence was key: the FEP subsumes predictive coding as one particular **process** that satisfies the more general variational principle\u301019\u2020L13-L21\u3011. \n\nDuring the same period, theoretical neuroscience was awash with Bayesian ideas. The **Bayesian brain hypothesis** \u2013 the notion that the brain encodes probability distributions and optimally combines prior beliefs with sensory evidence \u2013 became a popular framework to interpret perception and cognition. Karl Friston\u2019s contribution was to unify these ideas (Helmholtz\u2019s inference, Bayesian brains, predictive coding) under one broad principle derived from statistical physics. Friston\u2019s early formulations (circa 2006\u20132010) drew an analogy between brain dynamics and principles of **thermodynamics**: just as physical systems tend to states of minimum energy, biological cognitive systems tend to states of minimum surprise (maximum model evidence)\u301018\u2020L255-L264\u3011. In 2010, Friston published \u201cThe Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?\u201d which explicitly positioned FEP as a candidate *unifying theory* for neuroscience\u301025\u2020L102-L110\u3011\u301025\u2020L113-L118\u3011. It was argued that many existing brain theories \u2013 from reinforcement learning (expected reward) to information-foraging and even neural Darwinism \u2013 all boil down to optimizing *value* or minimizing *prediction error*, which in turn can be seen as minimizing free energy\u301025\u2020L109-L118\u3011. Thus, the FEP was presented as an over-arching theoretical umbrella tying together disparate ideas with the mathematics of variational inference. \n\nIn summary, the historical trajectory of the FEP runs from **Helmholtz\u2019s 19th-century vision of the brain as an inference machine**, through **20th-century cybernetic principles** (Ashby\u2019s Good Regulator Theorem and the concept of self-organization), through the **predictive coding and Bayesian brain** models of the 1990s\u20132000s, and finally crystallizes in Friston\u2019s work in the late 2000s. Each of these streams contributed concepts that FEP generalizes: *inferential perception*, *error minimization*, *self-organization*, and *variational learning*. By integrating these, the FEP offers a single mathematical narrative for how living systems resist entropy and make sense of their world\u30107\u2020L54-L63\u3011\u301018\u2020L232-L240\u3011.\n\n## Perception, Action, Learning, and Decision-Making under the FEP\n\nOne of the strengths of the Free Energy Principle is that it provides a *single* normative objective (minimize free energy) that can be applied to many aspects of intelligent behavior. In Friston\u2019s framework, **perception**, **action**, **learning**, and **decision-making** are all cast as processes that serve the same goal \u2013 reducing free energy (and thereby reducing prediction errors or surprise)\u30107\u2020L15-L23\u3011. Below we outline how each of these cognitive functions is interpreted under the FEP:\n\n- **Perception (Inference)**: *Perception* is explained as the brain\u2019s inference of the hidden causes of sensory input. Under FEP, the agent possesses an internal generative model that predicts sensory observations; *perception* is the process of updating the parameters or states of this model to better fit the incoming data. By minimizing variational free energy with respect to its internal beliefs, the agent performs approximate Bayesian **posterior estimation** of the world\u2019s causes\u301018\u2020L236-L243\u3011. In simpler terms, perception equates to reducing prediction error: the brain adjusts its expectations (beliefs about causes) so that its predictions align with sensory evidence, thereby *explaining away* the input. This accounts for many perceptual phenomena: for example, optical illusions or predictive perceptual filling-in can be seen as the brain\u2019s generative model imposing its expectations. Mathematically, perceiving corresponds to maximizing the *accuracy* term in free energy (minimizing the error) while keeping complexity in check\u301018\u2020L236-L243\u3011. In the context of neural process theories, this is implemented by predictive coding circuits where prediction errors drive belief updates until errors are minimized\u301019\u2020L13-L21\u3011.\n\n- **Action (Active Inference)**: *Action* in the FEP is treated as *inference acting on the world*. If perception optimizes internal states to fit observations, action optimizes external states (through behavior) to fit the agent\u2019s predictions. This is often referred to as **active inference**: the agent selects actions that minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes, thereby fulfilling its own predictions and keeping sensory inputs within expected bounds\u301013\u2020L186-L194\u3011. In other words, an FEP-guided agent will act to make its sensations less surprising. For example, if your brain predicts you will see light, you might *take action* to turn on a lamp in a dark room \u2013 thus aligning reality with prediction. This dual strategy (either change the mind to fit the world, or change the world to fit the mind) is core to active inference. Technically, actions influence sensory data such that the *prediction error* is reduced, effectively *closing the perception-action loop* in a way that minimizes free energy\u301013\u2020L186-L194\u3011. The literature emphasizes that organisms do not passively perceive; they also *sample* their environment (through movements, eye saccades, foraging, etc.) to seek information that resolves uncertainty. Notably, the FEP predicts that agents will sometimes *seek out* new sensations if it ultimately helps reduce long-term uncertainty \u2013 a concept known as **epistemic foraging** or *epistemic value*. This resolves the apparent paradox of why agents explore novel situations despite a drive to minimize surprise: by exploring, the agent can gain information to better model the world, reducing future surprise\u301023\u2020L157-L165\u3011\u301023\u2020L167-L175\u3011. Thus, action under FEP has both pragmatic aspects (fulfilling immediate needs to maintain homeostasis) and epistemic aspects (gathering data to improve the model). Friston (and colleagues) formalize this through an *expected free energy* objective that includes an uncertainty-reduction term (intrinsic reward for information) alongside the usual extrinsic goals. In summary, **active inference generalizes the FEP to decision-making and behavior**, asserting that action policies are chosen to minimize the *expected* surprise (free energy) of outcomes\u301014\u2020L25-L32\u3011.\n\n- **Learning (Model Updating)**: *Learning* under the FEP refers to the slower process of adjusting the parameters of the generative model itself (e.g. synaptic weights or connection strengths in a neural network). While perception handles rapid state-estimation (inferring the current causes of input), learning handles the adaptation of the model so that future inference is improved. In variational inference terms, this is like refining the form of the model $p(o,z)$ to maximize model evidence over longer timescales. Free energy minimization provides a rule for learning via gradient descent on model parameters, often aligning with known forms of synaptic plasticity. Indeed, as noted in predictive coding accounts, performing gradient descent on free energy with respect to synaptic weights leads to something analogous to Hebbian updates\u301019\u2020L19-L27\u3011. The **recognition density** and **generative model** are continually tweaked so that the agent\u2019s predictions become more accurate in the long run (increasing the accuracy term of free energy and reducing complexity costs). This has been used to derive biologically plausible learning rules, such as those governing cortical plasticity or Dopamine-modulated learning of precisions (confidence) in the brain. In brief, learning is the *evidence-maximization* process by which the agent\u2019s internal model improves, enabling lower free energy (better predictions) in the future. Under the FEP, the only difference between perception and learning is timescale and scope: perception optimizes the latent *states* of the model (within the bounds of the current model structure), whereas learning optimizes the *parameters/structure* of the model itself.\n\n- **Decision-Making (Policy Selection)**: *Decision-making* can be viewed as an extension of active inference to sequential or long-horizon contexts. Given a set of possible actions or policies, the FEP framework says the agent should evaluate each policy in terms of its *expected free energy* (EFE). The EFE of a policy incorporates both predicted future *surprise* (how well the policy will keep sensations in expected bounds) and *epistemic gain* (how much the policy will reduce uncertainty about hidden states)\u301023\u2020L167-L175\u3011. By selecting the policy that minimizes expected free energy, the agent effectively balances **exploitation** (staying in familiar, rewarding states) with **exploration** (gathering information to reduce uncertainty). This approach to decision-making subsumes classical reward-based planning as a special case \u2013 reward can be treated as negative surprise with respect to preferred outcomes. But it adds an intrinsic drive to reduce uncertainty, often interpreted as curiosity or information-seeking. In practical terms, active inference agents plan by imagining outcomes (using their generative model) and scoring those imagined futures by how unsurprising or informative they would be. The policy leading to the \u201cleast surprising, most informative\u201d future is chosen\u301023\u2020L169-L177\u3011. This principle has been shown to account for exploratory behaviors in animals and humans that pure reward-maximization (as in standard reinforcement learning) might not explain. It is important to note that in the FEP, *action and perception are deeply coupled*: as the agent makes observations, it updates beliefs (perception), which in turn inform its next action choice, forming a continuous perception\u2013action cycle optimized to minimize free energy at all times\u301013\u2020L186-L194\u3011.\n\nIn summary, the Free Energy Principle offers a unified description of diverse cognitive functions. *Perception* is Bayesian inference minimizing sensory prediction errors; *action* is chosen to realize the predictions (thus minimizing error via changing the world); *learning* is the adjustment of the internal model to better predict sensory data; and *decision-making* extends action selection over time by minimizing expected free energy (balancing exploitation of known outcomes with exploration for learning). All these processes can be seen as different facets of **self-organized information processing** that keeps the organism within viable, low-surprise states\u30107\u2020L15-L23\u3011\u30109\u2020L68-L76\u3011.\n\n## Applications and Empirical Implementations of the FEP\n\nSince its inception, the Free Energy Principle and its active-inference corollary have inspired numerous applications across neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and beyond. Here we provide an overview of domains where the FEP has been **concretely implemented or tested**, and contrast them with areas where it remains a **theoretical proposal**.\n\n### Implementations and Empirical Evidence\n\nDespite the abstract nature of the FEP, researchers have made significant strides in applying and testing it in practice. In neuroscience, **empirical validation** of the FEP has begun to emerge. For example, a recent study by T. Isomura, K. Friston, and colleagues (2023) used *in vitro* networks of rat cortical neurons to test whether neural circuits self-organize in accordance with free-energy minimization\u301024\u2020L77-L85\u3011. In their experiments, living neural networks were given a task of *causal inference* (distinguishing two mixed input sources). Remarkably, the networks adjusted their synaptic connections such that they encoded the hidden causes (the two sources) and did so in a way that **reduced variational free energy** of the network\u2019s activity\u301024\u2020L77-L85\u3011\u301024\u2020L86-L89\u3011. When the experimenters perturbed the networks (pharmacologically altering neuronal excitability), the networks\u2019 inference deteriorated in a manner consistent with the FEP\u2019s predictions (analogous to changing the prior precision in the generative model)\u301024\u2020L77-L85\u3011. This *quantitative confirmation* showed that variational free-energy minimization can predict the patterns of neural plasticity and firing in a biological system\u301024\u2020L83-L89\u3011. It constitutes one of the first direct empirical validations of the FEP\u2019s applicability to neural dynamics, lending support to the idea that real neuronal networks may indeed adhere to free energy minimization principles.\n\nIn cognitive and computational neuroscience, the FEP has been implemented in numerous **simulation models** to explain perception and behavior. **Active inference agents** \u2013 computational models that perceive and act by minimizing expected free energy \u2013 have been used to simulate behaviors in brain-inspired tasks. For instance, active inference models have replicated eye movements in visual searches, human-like foraging strategies, and even psychopathological phenomena (by tweaking precision parameters to mimic hallucinations or delusions). In brain imaging, **Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM)** \u2013 a method developed by Friston for interpreting fMRI/EEG data \u2013 employs variational Bayesian techniques (essentially free energy minimization) to estimate neural circuit parameters\u301018\u2020L236-L243\u3011. The success of DCM in explaining experimental data can be viewed as an applied testament to the FEP\u2019s usefulness: it treats the brain as a generative model and fits that model to data by maximizing model evidence (minimizing free energy).\n\nAnother active area of implementation is **robotics and machine intelligence**. Researchers have begun designing robots and AI agents that use active inference rather than traditional control or reinforcement-learning algorithms. In one proof-of-concept, a simulated robotic arm (7 degrees-of-freedom) was controlled by an active inference scheme that optimized a free-energy criterion instead of a classical controller\u301014\u2020L21-L24\u3011. The robot\u2019s task (reaching a target) could be achieved by defining a *preferred sensory state* (e.g., seeing the end-effector at the target) and then having the robot perform actions that minimize the discrepancy (prediction error) between its predicted sensor readings and this preferred state. Initial studies report that such controllers are viable, and in some cases robust to uncertainty, since the robot is essentially *modeling its own sensory consequences* and adapting on the fly. Active inference has also been tested on mobile robots for navigation tasks, where the robots form beliefs about their location and update them via sensory inputs while choosing movements that reduce uncertainty about the environment. These implementations illustrate that the FEP\u2019s principles can be translated into real-world agent behavior. In general, **FEP-based agents** can exhibit strong performance in certain settings by leveraging their generative model to plan (analogous to model-based RL), sometimes even outperforming purely reinforcement-based agents when there is a need for high adaptability or when encountering novel situations\u301013\u2020L193-L198\u3011.\n\nIn the domain of **machine learning**, the influence of the FEP is evident in algorithms that blend learning and inference. As noted earlier, variational autoencoders and related deep learning models explicitly maximize an evidence lower bound (the negative free energy)\u301018\u2020L269-L271\u3011. Beyond that, some researchers have incorporated *intrinsic motivation* terms inspired by free energy into reinforcement learning agents. For example, adding an *information gain* (uncertainty reduction) reward \u2013 effectively an FEP-style epistemic drive \u2013 can improve exploration in complex environments\u30107\u2020L29-L37\u3011\u30107\u2020L25-L33\u3011. The **Dreamer3** deep RL algorithm mentioned in a recent overview (Zhang & Xu 2024) is one such case, where expected information gain (an FEP-like term) was added to the objective function to encourage exploration\u30107\u2020L31-L39\u3011. The result was improved performance, suggesting that active inference principles can enhance AI agents by enabling them to seek information and adapt generatively.\n\nIn summary, the FEP has moved from theory to practice in several areas:  \n- **Neuroscience experiments:** confirming that neural networks conform to free-energy predictions\u301024\u2020L77-L85\u3011\u301024\u2020L86-L89\u3011.  \n- **Computational models of the brain:** using active inference to simulate perception/action and explaining empirical data (e.g. via DCM).  \n- **Robotics and AI:** designing agents that act according to free energy minimization, successfully completing control and decision tasks\u301014\u2020L21-L24\u3011.  \n- **Machine Learning:** influencing algorithms through variational objectives and intrinsic motivation akin to expected free energy\u30107\u2020L25-L33\u3011.\n\nThese implementations demonstrate that the FEP is not just abstract philosophy \u2013 it can be operationalized in models and machines, providing a unifying design principle for intelligent systems. That said, many of these applications are still in early stages, and the FEP\u2019s full potential in engineering and biomedicine is an ongoing area of research.\n\n### Theoretical Extensions and Open Domains\n\nBeyond the domains where it has been implemented, the Free Energy Principle has inspired **theoretical extensions into many other fields** \u2013 sometimes far from its neuroscience origin. Because the FEP is framed as a very general statement about self-organizing systems, scholars have explored its implications for any system that maintains a boundary and exchanges information with an environment (defined formally via a Markov blanket). This has led to proposals that the FEP could apply to, for example, **biology at large, evolution, psychology, sociology, and even physics**. \n\nA number of interdisciplinary researchers have posited that **life itself can be characterized as an FEP-driven process**. In this view, organisms across scales \u2013 from single cells to ecosystems \u2013 appear to \u201cmodel\u201d their niche and resist entropy. There are theoretical papers applying active inference to single-cell dynamics (chemotaxis modeled as free-energy minimization), to immune system responses, and to evolutionary adaptations (organisms evolving to better predict and fit their environment). These remain at the level of models or analogies, but they underscore the ambition of the FEP as a *unifying theory of life and mind*. Some authors (e.g. in theoretical biology and cybernetics) draw parallels between FEP and earlier principles like **Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s negentropy** (life imports order) and **Ashby\u2019s Good Regulator Theorem** (an effective regulator must internalize a model of the system it regulates)\u301018\u2020L255-L264\u3011.\n\nIn the realms of **cognitive science and social science**, the FEP has been extended to phenomena like **the self and social interaction**. For instance, concepts of *shared intentionality* and *communication* have been interpreted through active inference \u2013 e.g., two agents engaging in dialogue can be seen as coupling their generative models to minimize free energy in a joint exchange. The FEP has been invoked to explain the emergence of **language** (as a tool to reduce uncertainty in a population), the dynamics of **cultural practices**, and even **societal systems** like economies or internet echo chambers (where agents act to minimize surprise given their worldview, sometimes leading to self-reinforcing bubbles). Indeed, recent works explicitly apply the FEP to **sociology, linguistics, semiotics, and epidemiology**\u301018\u2020L262-L267\u3011. These applications are highly speculative and typically do not provide quantitative tests; rather, they demonstrate the *theoretical reach* of the FEP \u2013 its concepts of inference and surprise minimization can be mapped onto many adaptive systems. Whether this yields new insights or just rephrases existing ideas in FEP terms is an open question, leading to active debate in the literature.\n\nAnother area of theoretical extension is in understanding **mental disorders and neuropsychiatry**. Friston and others have suggested that disorders like schizophrenia, autism, and depression can be conceptualized as dysfunctions in the brain\u2019s inference process under the FEP\u301013\u2020L193-L198\u3011. For example, schizophrenia has been modeled as a case of abnormally high or low precision weighting on prediction errors \u2013 meaning certain hallucinations or delusions arise because the brain either over- or under-weights sensory evidence relative to priors, failing to properly minimize free energy. Similarly, autism spectrum conditions have been hypothesized to involve overly precise predictions that make the world feel overwhelmingly surprising when violated (the \u201cprecision of prediction errors\u201d account). These proposals, often under the umbrella of **Predictive Processing accounts of psychopathology**, are intriguing and have some support from computational modeling and neuroimaging studies. However, they are not yet confirmed by decisive empirical tests and thus remain theoretical frameworks for interpreting clinical observations. The FEP provides a common language to discuss how various factors (neuromodulators like dopamine, for instance) might tune the brain\u2019s inferential machinery and how their dysregulation leads to symptomatic outcomes.\n\nIt should be noted that the extraordinarily broad scope claimed by the FEP has elicited a fair share of **criticism and debate**. Some scholars have questioned whether the FEP is falsifiable or even scientifically meaningful. At face value, the principle can appear almost tautological: any equilibrium-seeking system might be described in terms of some function being minimized, so what does it predict? Critics have called it *\u201can unfalsifiable tautology\u201d*, warning that if a theory explains everything, it risks explaining nothing\u301013\u2020L199-L207\u3011\u301020\u2020L5-L8\u3011. Karl Friston and colleagues have responded by emphasizing that the FEP is a *mathematical principle* \u2013 akin to the principle of least action in physics \u2013 and not a specific process hypothesis\u301013\u2020L199-L207\u3011. In Friston\u2019s words, trying to falsify the FEP itself is a *category mistake*: one should instead investigate whether particular **process theories** (like a neural network using predictive coding) instantiate the principle in real systems\u301013\u2020L209-L217\u3011. Thus, the FEP\u2019s proponents view it as a unifying lens or \u201cmathematical truth\u201d about adaptive systems, which by design cannot be empirically false, whereas the utility of the framework lies in the specific models and predictions derived from it in various domains.\n\nAnother well-known critique is the **\u201cdark room problem\u201d** (briefly alluded to earlier). If organisms seek to minimize surprise, why don\u2019t they all just retire to static, predictable environments (like a dark, quiet room) and stay there? Clearly, biological agents *do* seek novelty, play, and exploration\u301023\u2020L157-L165\u3011, which seems contradictory. The resolution within the FEP is that agents have *prior preferences* (a part of their model) for certain sensory states \u2013 typically those that signify viability (food, mates, etc.) \u2013 and these preferences ensure that \u201cboring\u201d or physically harmful states are actually high free-energy states for the agent (even if they are predictable)\u301023\u2020L161-L169\u3011. Moreover, as mentioned, the drive for information gain (epistemic value) means that an agent finds sustained total predictability *unsurprising but dissatisfying* because it offers no new information and might threaten long-term adaptability. In practice, active inference models include preference (or *utility*) terms and an intrinsic curiosity term so that the agent *prefers* not to stay in a dark room unless that truly is its evolutionary niche. This explanation has largely addressed the dark-room paradox in theory, but it highlights the importance of properly specifying an agent\u2019s model and prior beliefs when applying the FEP to any real scenario.\n\nFinally, there are active discussions about how **\u201cdeep\u201d the FEP\u2019s explanations go**. Some researchers embrace the FEP as a potential *Theory of Everything for cognition and life*, while others urge a more cautious interpretation \u2013 seeing it as a unifying vocabulary that needs grounding by detailed models and empirical work. There have been efforts to simplify the presentation of FEP to make it more accessible (e.g. tutorials that step through the math in plain language\u301020\u2020L9-L17\u3011) and technical critiques clarifying certain assumptions (such as whether certain physics analogies hold rigorously\u301020\u2020L13-L17\u3011). These discussions are healthy for a nascent framework and indicate that while the FEP is alluring in its scope, the science is still in progress to determine how powerful it ultimately is in explaining and predicting real-world phenomena.\n\n**In summary**, the Free Energy Principle has a growing list of *theoretical extensions*: from cells to societies, many systems have been viewed through the FEP lens, suggesting a fundamental continuity in how *adaptive inference* might occur at different scales. However, many of these applications are currently conceptual and await empirical corroboration. At the same time, the FEP has sparked debates about scientific testability and usefulness. It remains an evolving framework \u2013 one that is continuously being refined through both theoretical discourse and practical modeling. What is clear is that Karl Friston\u2019s principle has already succeeded in provoking a rich dialogue across disciplines, encouraging researchers to think in terms of generative models, information, and adaptation in a unified way.\n\n## References\n\n- Friston, K.

It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning,",

              "### Core Mathematical Scaffold of the Free-Energy Principle (FEP)\n\nBelow is a compact, self-contained map of the formal machinery.  All symbols are defined as they appear.\n\n---\n\n#### 1.  Generative Model  \n\n*Hidden variables* \\(z\\) (e.g. world causes) generate *observations* \\(o\\) under parameters \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[\np_\\theta(o,z)=p_\\theta(o\\mid z)\\,p_\\theta(z).\n\\]\n\nThe agent **possesses** this model; learning adjusts \\(\\theta\\).\n\n---\n\n#### 2.  Surprise (Self-Information)  \n\n\\[\n\\mathcal S(o)\\;=\\;-\\ln p_\\theta(o) .\n\\]\n\nMinimising long-run average surprise (entropy) keeps the agent in unsurprising, life-supporting states, but \\(\\mathcal S(o)\\) is *intractable* because it requires the true posterior \\(p(z\\mid o)\\).\n\n---\n\n#### 3.  Variational Free Energy  \n\nIntroduce an arbitrary *recognition* (approximate posterior) density \\(q(z)\\).  Define  \n\n\\[\nF[q,o] \\;=\\; \\underbrace{ \\int q(z)\\,\\ln\\frac{q(z)}{p_\\theta(o,z)}\\,dz }_{\\text{KL term} \\;+\\; \\text{const}}\n\\;=\\; D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\!\\bigl[q(z)\\,\\Vert\\,p_\\theta(z\\mid o)\\bigr]\\;-\\;\\ln p_\\theta(o).\n\\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[\nF \\ge \\mathcal S(o),\\quad\\text{and }F=\\mathcal S(o)\n\\text{ iff } q(z)=p_\\theta(z\\mid o).\n\\]\n\nSo **minimising free energy w.r.t. \\(q\\)** is **variational Bayes**; free energy is the *computable* upper bound the agent can act on.\n\n---\n\n#### 4.  Accuracy\u2013Complexity Decomposition  \n\nRewrite:\n\n\\[\nF \\;=\\; -\\!\\underbrace{\\mathbb E_{q}\\bigl[\\ln p_\\theta(o\\mid z)\\bigr]}_{\\text{Accuracy}}\n\\;+\\; \\underbrace{D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\!\\bigl[q(z)\\,\\Vert\\,p_\\theta(z)\\bigr]}_{\\text{Complexity}} .\n\\]\n\nGradient descent on \\(q\\) (fast) improves accuracy; descent on \\(\\theta\\) (slow) regularises complexity \u2013 i.e. *learning*.\n\n---\n\n#### 5.  Gradient-Flow (Predictive-Coding) Dynamics  \n\nAssume a Gaussian recognition density  \n\\(q(z)=\\mathcal N(z;\\,\\mu,\\Sigma)\\) (Laplace approximation).  \nFree energy under this form yields prediction errors  \n\\(\\varepsilon^o = o - f(\\mu)\\),  \n\\(\\varepsilon^\\mu = \\mu - g(\\mu)\\).  \n\nCanonical flows:\n\n\\[\n\\dot\\mu = -\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\mu},\\qquad\n\\dot\\theta = -\\eta_\\theta\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\theta},\n\\]\n\nimplemented neurally by **descending predictions** \\(f(\\mu)\\) and **ascending errors** \\(\\varepsilon\\); this is exactly hierarchical predictive coding.\n\n---\n\n#### 6.  Active Inference (Action Selection)\n\nLet actions \\(a\\) change sensory input via \\(o=o(a)\\).  \nFree-energy gradients over *active* states:\n\n\\[\n\\dot a = -\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial a}\n      = -\\bigl(\\partial_a o\\bigr)^\\top \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial o},\n\\]\n\nso behaviour samples the world to *fulfil predictions* (closing the perception\u2013action loop).\n\n---\n\n#### 7.  Expected Free Energy for Policies  \n\nFor a future action-sequence (policy) \\(\\pi\\) over horizon \\(T\\):\n\n\\[\nG(\\pi) \\;=\\; \\mathbb E_{p(o_{1:T},z_{1:T}\\mid\\pi)}\\!\n\\Bigl[\\ln q(z_{1:T}\\mid\\pi)-\\ln p_\\theta(o_{1:T},z_{1:T}\\mid\\pi)\\Bigr].\n\\]\n\nDecomposes into  \n\n\\[\nG(\\pi) = \\underbrace{\\mathbb E\\bigl[-\\ln p_\\theta(o_{1:T})\\bigr]}_{\\text{Risk}}\n        +\\underbrace{ \\mathbb E\\bigl[D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\!\\bigl[q(z_{1:T}\\mid\\pi)\\,\\Vert\\,p_\\theta(z_{1:T}\\mid o_{1:T})\\bigr]\\bigr]}_{\\text{Ambiguity}},\n\\]\n\ncapturing **pragmatic value** (risk) and **epistemic value** (information gain).  \nThe agent chooses  \n\n\\[\n\\pi^\\star = \\arg\\min_\\pi G(\\pi).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### 8.  Markov-Blanket Partition  \n\nStates factor into internal \\(x\\), sensory \\(s\\), active \\(a\\), and external \\(y\\).  \nConditional independences  \n\n\\[\np(x,y,s,a) = p(x\\mid s,a)\\,p(y\\mid s,a)\\,p(s\\mid y)\\,p(a\\mid x)\n\\]\n\ndefine the **Markov blanket**; gradient flows on internal \\((x)\\) and active \\((a)\\) states minimise blanket-level free energy and thereby enslave external dynamics \\(y\\) to the agent\u2019s model.\n\n---\n\n### Minimal Take-Home\n\n1. **Free energy** \\(F[q,o]\\) upper-bounds surprise.  \n2. **Perception** \\(= \\displaystyle\\arg\\min_q F\\) (state inference).  \n3. **Learning** \\(= \\displaystyle\\arg\\min_\\theta F\\) (parameter inference).  \n4. **Action** \\(= \\displaystyle\\arg\\min_a F\\) (active inference).  \n5. **Planning** chooses policies that minimise **expected** free energy \\(G\\).  \n\nEverything else\u2014predictive coding circuitry, epistemic curiosity, homeostatic behaviour\u2014drops out of these coupled gradient flows."

In Friston's formulation, internal and active flows are often gradient flows with respect to free energy, but this is generally under the Laplace assumption. We need to explain how the solenoidal flow arises, its role, and how it is sometimes neglected."

There are *several different functionals* that go by the name \u201cfree energy\u201d.  \n2. \u201cMinimisation\u201d is meant in the sense of **gradient-flow dissipation** (monotone decay of a functional) rather than \u201cfinding and sitting at a global minimum\u201d.  \n3. Once you add *noise, parameter learning,* or *solenoidal currents*, the pointwise value of free energy along a single trajectory can fluctuate \u2013 yet the *expected* or *ensemble* free energy is still Lyapunov-like.\n\nBelow is the rigorous picture.\n\n---\n\n## 1\u2003Which functional are we talking about?\n\n| Symbol | Domain | Held fixed when differentiating | Typical role |\n|--------|--------|---------------------------------|--------------|\n| \\(F(q,o)\\) | recognition density \\(q(\\,)\\) | generative model \\(p_\\theta\\) **and** current observation \\(o\\) | **Variational free energy** (VB-ELBO). |\n| \\(F_t = F(q_t,o_t)\\) | internal states/parameters \\((x_t,\\theta_t)\\) via \\(q_t\\) | the external plant *during infinitesimal step* | \u201cInstantaneous\u201d free energy for gradient dynamics. |\n| \\(G(\\pi)\\) | policies \\(\\pi\\) | nothing \u2013 it is prospective | **Expected** free energy (planning). |\n\nOnly the *first* two are candidates for Lyapunov functions of the fast neural\u2013motor flow \\((x_t,a_t)\\).\n\n---\n\n## 2\u2003Deterministic gradient\u2013curl decomposition\n\nWrite the deterministic closed-loop dynamics on the blanket plus internal states \\(z=(x,a)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dot z = -\\bigl(G(z)+Q(z)\\bigr)\\nabla_z F_t .\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n* \\(G\\succeq 0\\) is symmetric (Riemannian metric / precision).  \n* \\(Q=-Q^\\top\\) is antisymmetric (solenoidal \u201ccurl\u201d part).  \n* \\(F_t\\) depends on \\(z\\) only through the sufficient statistics of \\(q_t\\).\n\nThen\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dF_t}{dt} \\;=\\; \\nabla F_t^{\\!\\top}\\dot z\n                 \\;=\\; -\\nabla F_t^{\\!\\top}G\\nabla F_t\n                 \\;\\;\\le 0.\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nBecause the \\(Q\\)-term drops out, the *instantaneous* variational free energy **is a Lyapunov function for the deterministic flow** as long as:\n\n* the generative model \\(p_\\theta\\) is held fixed; and  \n* we look at the *internal/active* subsystem \\((x,a)\\) (external states follow slavishly through the blanket).\n\nThe solenoidal current merely moves the system **along** level sets of \\(F_t\\); it cannot increase \\(F_t\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3\u2003Why you sometimes see \\(F_t\\) go *up*\n\n1. **Parameter (structural) learning**  \n   When \\(\\theta_t\\) is itself updated by  \n   \\[\n   \\dot\\theta = -\\eta_\\theta\\nabla_\\theta F_t ,\n   \\]\n   the chain rule introduces a second term  \n   \\[\n   \\tfrac{dF_t}{dt} = (\\nabla_zF_t)^{\\!\\top}\\dot z + (\\nabla_\\theta F_t)^{\\!\\top}\\dot\\theta.\n   \\]\n   The first term is negative-semidefinite, the second negative-definite (for sufficiently small steps).  \n   *Moment-to-moment*, however, the signs can oppose and the total can transiently increase.\n\n2. **Stochastic forcing**  \n   Additive (Ito) noise gives the SDE  \n   \\[\n   dZ_t = -L\\nabla F_t\\,dt + \\sqrt{2\\sigma G}\\,dW_t .\n   \\]\n   Along a *single sample path* \\(F_t\\) is no longer monotone.  \n   The Lyapunov statement moves to the **expectation**  \n   \\[\n   \\tfrac{d}{dt}\\,\\mathbb E[F_t] = -\\mathbb E\\!\\bigl[\\nabla F_t^{\\!\\top}G\\nabla F_t\\bigr]\\le 0.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Discrete-time numerical schemes**  \n   Euler updates of the form \\(z_{k+1}=z_k-\\eta L\\nabla F_k\\) only guarantee monotone \\(F_k\\) for \\(\\eta<2/\\lambda_{\\max}(LG)\\).

              "### \u201cFree-energy minimisation\u201d in Friston\u2019s sense  \n*(why the phrase is technically sound, though easy to misread)*  \n\n---\n\n#### 1\u2003What mathematicians mean by \u201cminimisation\u201d\n\nIn optimisation theory **\u201cminimise F\u201d** is shorthand for *follow a descent direction of* \\(F\\).  \nUnless we add extra hypotheses (convexity, coercivity, etc.) that phrase **never** implies  \n\n* convergence in finite time,  \n* convergence at all (a noisy gradient flow can wander for ever),  \n* or arrival at a *global* minimum.\n\nThe only universal statement is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} F(z_t)\\;\\le\\;0,\n\\]\n\ni.e. **monotone decrease along admissible trajectories**.  \nIn that weak (but standard) sense, if we set up a differential equation\n\n\\[\n\\dot z_t\\;=\\;-\\,\\mathbf M(z_t)\\,\\nabla F(z_t),\n\\tag{A}\n\\]\n\nwith a positive-definite metric \\(\\mathbf M\\succ0\\), we have *variational minimisation*:  \n\\(F\\) cannot increase, and any \\(\\omega\\)-limit set lies in \\(\\{\\nabla F=0\\}\\).  \nThat is *all* Friston needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 2\u2003Why \\(F\\) **is** a Lyapunov function\u2014for the right subsystem\n\nTake the internal \\((x)\\) and active \\((a)\\) blanket states collected in \\(z\\).  \nFriston\u2019s deterministic core (ignoring noise) can always be written\n\n\\[\n\\dot z = -(G+Q)\\,\\nabla F ,\n\\qquad\nG=G^{\\!\\top}\\succ0,\\; Q=-Q^{\\!\\top}.\n\\tag{B}\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(Q\\) is antisymmetric,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dF}{dt}= -\\nabla F^{\\!\\top}G\\nabla F \\;\\le\\;0.\n\\tag{C}\n\\]\n\nHence  \n\n* \\(F\\) is **strict Lyapunov** for the *blanket-state* flow (it decreases strictly unless \\(\\nabla F=0\\));  \n* the skew (solenoidal) term \\(Q\\) cannot raise \\(F\\) because  \n  \\(\\nabla F^{\\!\\top}Q\\nabla F=0\\).\n\nWhat *fails* is that \\(F\\) need **not** be Lyapunov for the *externals* \\(y\\).  \nThose are altered only indirectly via \\((a)\\).  \nSo if one tracks all variables \\((y,s,a,x)\\) at once, \\(F\\) indeed lacks the global Lyapunov property\u2014hence the confusion.  Friston always restricts the claim to the *inference machinery* (blanket).\n\n---\n\n#### 3\u2003Why the flow need not settle at a point\n\nEven with (C) we can get **non-convergent** behaviour:\n\n* If \\(Q\\neq0\\) we may spiral around a level set of \\(F\\) that contains a *line* of critical points (common in under-determined recognition densities).  \n* Additive noise adds a martingale term; \\(F\\) then performs a biased stochastic drift.  The *ensemble average* still falls, but any sample path fluctuates.\n\nThese subtleties do **not** violate minimisation\u2014they merely show that \u201cminimisation\u201d \u2260 \u201cguaranteed unique fixed point\u201d.  Classical examples abound: overdamped Langevin dynamics on a multi-well potential still \u201cminimises\u201d the potential in expectation.\n\n---\n\n#### 4\u2003Why Friston keeps the word \u201cminimisation\u201d\n\n1. **Variational Bayes**: perception/learning solves  \n   \\(\\displaystyle \\min_{q,\\theta}F\\) exactly as in machine-learning textbooks.  \n   Calling that \u201cminimisation\u201d is orthodox.\n2. **Active inference**: actions flow along  \n   \\(\\displaystyle \\dot a=-\\partial_aF\\).  \n   That *is* gradient descent\u2014even if the environment pushes the minimum around.\n3. **Planning**: policies are chosen by (stochastic) gradient descent on the *expected* free energy \\(G\\).  \n\nIn every module the control law is a gradient (natural or Euclidean) of the relevant free-energy functional.  So the umbrella term \u201cminimisation\u201d is appropriate, provided one does not silently add the extra topological claims that mathematicians reserve for *convergent* minimisation.\n\n---\n\n#### 5\u2003If you need a textbook-rigorous statement\n\n> *Let \\(z_t\\) be the internal and active blanket states of a free-energy agent, evolving under (B) with \\(G\\succ0\\) smooth and \\(F\\in C^1\\) bounded from below.  Then \\(t\\mapsto F(z_t)\\) is non-increasing; every \\(\\omega\\)-limit point lies in the critical set \\(\\{\\nabla F=0\\}\\).  Provided that set contains only isolated points, the flow is LaSalle-asymptotically stable and converges to a (not necessarily global) local minimum of \\(F\\).*  \n\nThat theorem\u2014standard LaSalle + gradient flow\u2014captures *exactly* what Friston\u2019s \u201cfree-energy minimisation\u201d claims, and no more.  Once external states and non-isolated minima are allowed, convergence may fail, but we are still inside the remit of \u201cminimising a functional\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n*Friston\u2019s usage aligns with the variational and control-theoretic convention:* **a system that moves in a direction of steepest descent on a functional is said to \u201cminimise\u201d it**, even if (i) minima are only approached asymptotically, (ii) noise or solenoidal terms keep the system roaming, and (iii) the functional is Lyapunov only for a subsystem.  \nWhen those caveats are kept in mind, the terminology is mathematically defensible."

              "Below is a hierarchy of increasingly abstract ways to cast *constrained optimization*.  Each level nests the previous one, so you can pick the granularity that best suits a particular analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Classical finite-dimensional statement  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min_{x\\in\\mathbb R^{n}}\\;& f(x) \\\\[4pt]\n\\text{s.t. }\\;& g_i(x)\\le 0,\\quad i=1,\\dots,m,\\\\\n            & h_j(x)=0,\\quad j=1,\\dots,p.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n* **Variables:** \\(x\\) (decision vector).  \n* **Data:**  \n  * **Objective** \\(f:\\mathbb R^{n}\\to\\mathbb R\\cup\\{+\\infty\\}\\).  \n  * **Inequality constraints** \\(g_i:\\mathbb R^{n}\\to\\mathbb R\\).  \n  * **Equality constraints** \\(h_j:\\mathbb R^{n}\\to\\mathbb R\\).  \n\nAll other formulations can be derived by choosing special forms for \\(f,g_i,h_j\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Indicator-function (set-theoretic) form  \n\nLet the **feasible set** be  \n\n\\[\n\\mathcal C:=\\bigl\\{x\\in\\mathbb R^{n}: g_i(x)\\le 0,\\;h_j(x)=0\\bigr\\}.\n\\]\n\nIntroduce the indicator  \n\n\\[\n\\iota_{\\mathcal C}(x):=\n\\begin{cases}\n0,&x\\in\\mathcal C,\\\\\n+\\infty,&x\\notin\\mathcal C.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThen the problem is simply  \n\n\\[\n\\min_{x\\in\\mathbb R^{n}}\\;f(x)+\\iota_{\\mathcal C}(x),\n\\]\n\ni.e. *unconstrained* minimization of a possibly nonsmooth, extended-valued function.  \nThis is the form used in convex analysis and proximal algorithms.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Lagrangian and KKT system  \n\nDefine the **Lagrangian**\n\n\\[\nL(x,\\lambda,\\nu)=f(x)+\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\lambda_i g_i(x)+\\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\nu_j h_j(x),\n\\]\n\nwith multipliers \\(\\lambda\\in\\mathbb R_+^{m}\\), \\(\\nu\\in\\mathbb R^{p}\\).  \nUnder a regularity condition (e.g. LICQ, Slater, or a constraint qualification tailored to nonsmooth problems) a point \\((x^\\ast,\\lambda^\\ast,\\nu^\\ast)\\) is optimal iff the **Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker** (KKT) conditions hold  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\nabla_x L(x^\\ast,\\lambda^\\ast,\\nu^\\ast)=0 &\\text{(stationarity)}\\\\[4pt]\ng_i(x^\\ast)\\le0,\\;h_j(x^\\ast)=0 &\\text{(primal feasibility)}\\\\[4pt]\n\\lambda_i^\\ast\\ge0 &\\text{(dual feasibility)}\\\\[4pt]\n\\lambda_i^\\ast g_i(x^\\ast)=0 &\\text{(complementary slackness).}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSecond-order sufficiency adds \\(\\nabla_{xx}^2 L\\) restricted to the critical cone being positive definite.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Convex-conic template  \n\nLet \\(K\\subseteq \\mathbb R^{q}\\) be a closed convex cone.  Put your constraints into an *affine* map \\(A:\\mathbb R^{n}\\to\\mathbb R^{q}\\) and vector \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min_{x}\\;& c^{\\mathsf T}x \\\\\n\\text{s.t. }\\;& Ax+b\\in K.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSpecial cases:  \n| \\(K\\) | Model class | Typical solver |\n|-------|-------------|----------------|\n| \\(\\mathbb R_+^q\\) | Linear programming (LP) | simplex, interior point |\n| Second-order cone | SOCP | interior-point, ADMM |\n| Positive semidefinite cone \\(S_+^r\\) | Semidefinite programming (SDP) | interior-point, first-order splitting |\n\nThe conic dual is\n\n\\[\n\\max_{y\\in K^\\ast}\\; -b^{\\mathsf T}y\\quad\\text{s.t. }A^{\\mathsf T}y+c=0,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(K^\\ast\\) is the dual cone.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Infinite-dimensional / variational formulation  \n\nLet \\(X\\) be a Banach (or Hilbert) space, \\(F:X\\to\\mathbb R\\cup\\{\\infty\\}\\) lower semicontinuous, and \\(C\\subseteq X\\) closed:\n\n\\[\n\\min_{x\\in C}\\;F(x).\n\\]\n\n*Examples:*  \n* **Calculus of variations:** \\(X=W^{1,2}(\\Omega)\\), \\(F[u]=\\int_\\Omega \\Phi(x,u,\\nabla u)\\,dx\\).  \n* **Optimal control:** \\(X=L^2([0,T];\\mathbb R^m)\\) with dynamic constraints encoded via a linear operator.\n\nKarush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker generalises via subdifferentials and adjoint operators; Pontryagin\u2019s Maximum Principle is a manifestation.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Unified operator form  \n\nWrite constraints with a single mapping \\(G:X\\to Y\\) into an ordered space \\(Y\\) with cone \\(K\\):\n\n\\[\n\\min_{x\\in X}\\; F(x)\\quad\\text{s.t. }G(x)\\in -K.\n\\]\n\nThis compactly covers equalities (\\(K=\\{0\\}\\)), inequalities (\\(K=\\mathbb R_+^m\\)), conic, and even semidefinite constraints when \\(Y\\) is a symmetric matrix space.\n\n---\n\n## Key structural assumptions\n\n| Property | Consequence |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Convex \\(F\\) & \\(G\\)** | Any local optimum is global; strong duality under Slater. |\n| **Smooth & nonconvex** | KKT gives only necessary conditions; trust-region and penalty methods handle second-order structure. |\n| **Polyhedral \\(C\\)** | Simplex and active-set methods exploit sparsity; integrality yields MILP. |\n| **Cone self-duality** | Simplifies dual problem (e.g. SDP). |\n\n---\n\n### Canonical algorithmic bundles\n\n* **First-order splitting (proximal, ADMM, primal-dual):** exploits indicator-function view.  \n* **Interior-point:** exploits conic form and self-concordant barriers.  \n* **Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP):** solves a quadratic program built from KKT linearisation.  \n* **Augmented Lagrangian / penalty:** smoothes constraints into the objective.  \n\n---\n\n#### References (classical texts)\n\n1. Rockafellar, *Convex Analysis*.  \n2. Bertsekas, *Nonlinear Programming* (2nd ed.).  \n3. Nocedal & Wright, *Numerical Optimization* (3rd ed.).  \n4. Boyd & Vandenberghe, *Convex Optimization*.  \n\nThese collectively develop every layer above, from indicator functions to second-order theory and conic duality.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nAll constrained optimization can be seen as unconstrained minimization of \\(F(x)+\\iota_{C}(x)\\), with structure expressed through cones or operators.  KKT conditions and duality supply the universal optimality language, while specialised cones (polyhedral, second-order, semidefinite, etc.) organise both theory and algorithms."

              "### 1. \u201cPullback\u201d \u2013 the big picture\nAt its core, a **pullback** says \u201ccarry something back along a map\u201d.\n\n| Setting | Data you start with | Map you \u201cpull back\u201d along | Resulting pulled-back object |\n|---------|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Basic sets | A subset \\(S\\subset Y\\) | A function \\(f:X\\to Y\\) | The pre-image \\(f^{-1}(S)\\subset X\\) |\n| Differential geometry | A differential form \\(\\omega\\) on \\(Y\\) | \\(f:X\\to Y\\) (smooth) | A form \\(f^*\\omega\\) on \\(X\\) whose value at \\(x\\in X\\) is \\(\\omega\\) applied to \\(Df_x\\) |\n| Vector bundles | A bundle \\(E\\to Y\\) | \\(f:X\\to Y\\) | A new bundle \\(f^*E\\to X\\) whose fibre over \\(x\\) is the fibre of \\(E\\) over \\(f(x)\\) |\n| Category theory | Two arrows \\(A\\xrightarrow{g}C\\xleftarrow{h}B\\) | (No single map; we want a universal object) | The *pullback square* \\(A\\times_C B\\) making the diagram commute and universal among such objects |\n\nAcross all these examples the pattern is the same:\n\n1. **You have data living on/over a target space \\(Y\\).**\n2. **You have a map \\(f:X\\to Y\\).**\n3. **You create corresponding data on the source \\(X\\)** by \u201casking what the original data looks like when viewed through \\(f\\).\u201d\n\nBecause the construction reverses the direction of the arrow (data travels opposite the map), mathematicians call it **contravariant**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Pullback in dynamical systems\n\nFor time-dependent systems the idea of \u201cdragging things back\u201d becomes particularly useful.  If the evolution law itself changes with time (a *non-autonomous* system), trajectories starting now depend sensitively on how the system behaved in the past.  To describe long-term behavior we often let the *initial* time drift to \\(-\\infty\\) while we keep the *observation* time fixed.  That limiting viewpoint is the essence of a **pullback attractor**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Pullback attractor \u2014 formal yet intuitive definition\n\nConsider a non-autonomous ODE or PDE written abstractly as  \n\n\\[\n\\dot x = F(t,x),\\qquad x\\in X,\n\\]\n\nand let \\(\\Phi(t,s):X\\to X\\) be the evolution operator that pushes a state from time \\(s\\) to time \\(t\\) (\\(t\\ge s\\)).  \nA *pullback attractor* is a family of compact sets \\(\\{\\mathcal A(t)\\}_{t\\in\\mathbb R}\\) satisfying:\n\n1. **Invariance (covariance with time):**  \n   \\(\\Phi(t,s)\\,\\mathcal A(s)=\\mathcal A(t)\\) for every \\(t\\ge s\\).\n2. **Pullback attraction:** for every bounded set \\(B\\subset X\\),\n   \\[\n     \\lim_{\\tau\\to\\infty} \\operatorname{dist}\\bigl(\\Phi(t,t-\\tau)B,\\;\\mathcal A(t)\\bigr)=0\n     \\quad\\text{for each fixed }t.\n   \\]\n   Instead of pushing \\(B\\) forward from *now* to the distant future (the classical notion), we **pull the initial time back** (\\(t-\\tau\\to -\\infty\\)) and see where those very old states end up at the observation time \\(t\\).\n\n#### Why we need this concept\n* In a periodically forced system the phase of the forcing matters. A classical global attractor would try to squash everything into a single set, missing the time-dependent structure. A pullback attractor keeps the \u201csnapshot at time \\(t\\)\u201d description, preserving information about how the forcing history shapes the state.\n* In random dynamics (e.g., stochastic flows) the analogue is a *random pullback attractor*, again capturing history-dependent equilibrium.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Relationship to the ordinary (forward) attractor\n| Forward/global attractor (autonomous case) | Pullback attractor (non-autonomous case) |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Evolves under a fixed semigroup \\(\\Phi(t)\\). | Uses two-time map \\(\\Phi(t,s)\\). |\n| Attraction tested as \\(t\\to\\infty\\): \\(\\Phi(t)B\\to\\mathcal A\\). | Attraction tested by dragging *start time* back: \\(\\Phi(t,t-\\tau)B\\to\\mathcal A(t)\\). |\n| Single time-independent set. | Family of time-indexed sets; may be periodic, quasi-periodic, or otherwise non-stationary. |\n\nWhen the system actually *is* autonomous, both notions coincide and \\(\\mathcal A(t)\\equiv\\mathcal A\\).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Take-away\n*\u201cPullback\u201d* in mathematics means \u201cre-express what you know on the target space in terms of the source space by following arrows backward.\u201d  \nA **pullback attractor** applies that philosophy to non-autonomous dynamics: by letting the initial time retreat to the remote past, it captures the long-term state that every trajectory converges to *at each observation time*, respecting the system\u2019s intrinsic time dependence."

Semiflows are one-parameter processes, while processes with two parameters, like cocycles, can pose additional complexity. A pullback attractor requires evolution over two time components. In an autonomous semiflow, forward and pullback attractors coincide, but in non-autonomous cases where parameters depend on time, the dynamics change, affecting the attractor's behavior. The distinctions between semigroup, semiflow, and process are critical in understanding these systems."

              "Yes\u2014 but only in a rather degenerate way, and understanding *why* clarifies what the pullback notion is really for.\n\n---\n\n## 1  Semiflow versus two-parameter process\n\n| object | time parameters | cocycle law |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Semiflow** \\(\\,(\\Phi(t))_{t\\ge 0}\\) | single non-negative \\(t\\) measured **from the chosen initial time \\(0\\)** | \\(\\Phi(t)\\,\\Phi(s)=\\Phi(t+s)\\) |\n| **Process / cocycle** \\(\\,(\\Phi(t,s))_{t\\ge s}\\) | two times (start \\(s\\), finish \\(t\\)) | \\(\\Phi(t,s)\\,\\Phi(s,r)=\\Phi(t,r)\\) |\n\nThe pullback idea needs both a *start* and a *finish* time because attraction is tested by letting the **start time \\(s\\to-\\infty\\)** while keeping the observation time \\(t\\) fixed.  \nA bare semiflow offers no separate start time; everything is measured relative to \u201ctime zero\u201d.  So to talk about pullback attraction we first embed the semiflow in a two-parameter setting:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(t,s)\\;x \\;=\\; \\Phi\\bigl(t-s\\bigr)\\,x,\n\\qquad t\\ge s.\n\\]\n\nHere \\(\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}\\) is just the original autonomous evolution, but now indexed by *both* times; it satisfies the cocycle law automatically.\n\n---\n\n## 2  What happens to the pullback definition?\n\nWith that embedding the pullback attractor family\n\\[\n\\mathcal A(t)\n\\quad\\text{such that}\\quad\n\\lim_{\\tau\\to\\infty}\\operatorname{dist}\\bigl(\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(t,t-\\tau)B,\\;\\mathcal A(t)\\bigr)=0\n\\]\nreduces to the usual forward/global attractor:\n\n* \\(\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}(t,t-\\tau)B=\\Phi(\\tau)B\\), so pullback attraction is *exactly* forward attraction as \\(\\tau\\to\\infty\\).\n* Invariance becomes \\(\\Phi(t-s)\\mathcal A(s)=\\mathcal A(t)\\); since the semigroup is autonomous, choosing \\(s=0\\) forces \\(\\mathcal A(t)\\equiv\\mathcal A\\) independent of \\(t\\).\n\nHence for an autonomous semiflow the \u201cpullback attractor\u201d exists if and only if the usual global attractor exists, and the two notions coincide.\n\n---\n\n## 3  So when is pullback *really* interesting?\n\nWhenever the evolution law itself depends on an external time variable\u2014periodic forcing, quasiperiodic driving, stochastic noise, slowly varying parameters, etc.\u2014the one-parameter semigroup model no longer applies.  One must work with a process/cocycle, and then the pullback family \\(\\{\\mathcal A(t)\\}\\) captures the genuinely time-dependent equilibrium structure.  In that setting:\n\n* \\(\\mathcal A(t)\\) may be \\(T\\)-periodic (periodically forced system),\n* or may track a slowly drifting equilibrium in an adiabatically changing system,\n* or may be a random set \\(\\mathcal A(\\omega,t)\\) for each noise realisation \\(\\omega\\) in random dynamical systems.\n\nThose subtleties are invisible in a pure semiflow.\n\n---\n\n## 4  Bottom line\n\n*Technically*, every semiflow can be given a (boring) pullback attractor\u2014the ordinary global attractor.  \n*Conceptually*, the pullback framework is designed for **non-autonomous** dynamics; once the evolution is autonomous, the \u201cpullback\u201d label adds no new information."
