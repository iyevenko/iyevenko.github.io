              "Below is a compact but fully explicit way to cast (model-free, gradient\u2013based) reinforcement learning as a **discrete-time, stochastic dynamical system** and, in the limit of small steps, as a **deterministic ODE on a product manifold**.  The notation is minimal but sufficient to connect every RL element with standard dynamical-systems terminology.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Spaces and variables  \n\n| Symbol | Role | Typical dimension |\n|--------|------|-------------------|\n| \\(s_t \\in \\mathcal S\\) | environment (world) state | \\(n\\) |\n| \\(\\theta_t \\in \\Theta\\subset\\mathbb R^d\\) | agent parameters (e.g. policy weights) | \\(d\\) |\n| \\(a_t \\in \\mathcal A\\) | action produced by policy | \\(m\\) |\n| \\(r_t\\in\\mathbb R\\) | reward | 1 |\n\nEverything evolves at integer time \\(t\\in\\mathbb N\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Environment evolution (controlled plant)\n\n\\[\ns_{t+1}=f(s_t,\\;a_t,\\;w_t),\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(f:\\mathcal S\\times\\mathcal A\\times\\mathcal W\\to\\mathcal S\\) is a (possibly stochastic) transition map,  \n* \\(w_t\\) is exogenous noise i.i.d. on \\(\\mathcal W\\).\n\nThis is an **iterated map** on \\(\\mathcal S\\).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Agent (controller) with internal learning\n\n**Action selection**\n\n\\[\na_t=\\pi_{\\theta_t}(s_t,\\;u_t),\\qquad u_t\\sim\\mathcal U,\n\\]\n\nwith exploration noise \\(u_t\\).  \nSo the policy is a map \\(\\pi:\\Theta\\times \\mathcal S\\times\\mathcal U\\to\\mathcal A\\).\n\n**Parameter update (e.g. stochastic gradient ascent)**\n\n\\[\n\\theta_{t+1}= \\theta_t + \\alpha_t\\,g\\bigl(\\theta_t,\\;s_t,\\;a_t,\\;r_t,\\;s_{t+1}\\bigr),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\alpha_t>0\\) is the step size.  This is a **stochastic approximation** step.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Closed-loop state vector and semiflow\n\nDefine the augmented state  \n\n\\[\nx_t := (s_t,\\theta_t) \\in \\mathcal X := \\mathcal S \\times \\Theta.\n\\]\n\nCollecting (2)\u2013(3) gives a **Markovian difference equation**\n\n\\[\nx_{t+1}=F(x_t,\\;\\xi_t),\\qquad\n\\xi_t:=(w_t,u_t,z_t),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(z_t\\) contains any further sampling needed to compute \\(g\\).  \nThus \\(F:\\mathcal X\\times\\Xi\\to\\mathcal X\\) is a *random map*, and  \n\\(\\{x_t\\}_{t\\ge 0}\\) is a **random dynamical system (RDS)** on \\(\\mathcal X\\).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Mean-field / small-step limit  \n\nAssume (i) \\(\\alpha_t=\\varepsilon\\ll 1\\) is constant,  \n(ii) rewards and gradients are bounded with finite noise variance,  \n(iii) the Markov chain for \\(s_t\\) under a fixed \\(\\theta\\) is ergodic.  \nStandard weak-convergence arguments (Borkar & Meyn, Kushner & Yin):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta),\\\\[8pt]\n\\dfrac{ds}{dt} = f\\bigl(s,\\pi_\\theta(s)\\bigr),\n\\end{cases}\\qquad (s,\\theta)\\in\\mathcal X,\n\\]\n\nwhere the expectation over \\(w,u\\) has removed stochasticity.  \nThis **ODE on \\(\\mathcal X\\)** is a *deterministic semiflow*  \n\\(\\Phi_t:\\mathcal X\\to\\mathcal X\\).\n\n* **Fixed points:** \\(\\nabla_\\theta J=0\\) and \\(s=f(s,\\pi_\\theta(s))\\); these correspond to policies that are locally optimal and induce environment stationarity.  \n* **Stability:** Lyapunov function \\(V(\\theta)=J^\\star-J(\\theta)\\) yields \\(\\dot V\\le 0\\).  \n* **Attractors:** An optimal policy manifold acts as an attractor for the learning dynamics, while the environment trajectory may have its own attractor conditioned on that policy.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Density evolution (Liouville / Fokker\u2013Planck viewpoint)\n\nLet \\(\\rho_t(x)\\) be the pdf of \\(x_t\\).  For the discrete RDS,\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{t+1}(y)=\\int_{\\mathcal X}\\!\\int_\\Xi\n\\delta\\!\\bigl(y-F(x,\\xi)\\bigr)\\,\\rho_t(x)\\,p_\\Xi(d\\xi)\\,dx.\n\\]\n\nIn the continuous limit,\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t \\rho = -\\nabla_x\\!\\cdot\\!\\bigl(F_{\\text{det}}(x)\\,\\rho\\bigr)\n                + \\tfrac12\\nabla_x^\\top D(x)\\,\\nabla_x \\rho,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(D\\) is the diffusion tensor induced by gradient noise.  \nThis is a **Fokker\u2013Planck equation** on \\(\\mathcal X\\).\n\n---\n\n### 7. Interpretation\n\n* **RL \u2259 control + adaptation:**  \n  Environment dynamics \\(f\\) are classical plant equations;  \n  parameter dynamics \\(g\\) give the learning law.\n\n* **Policy-space flow:**  \n  Training traces an orbit in \\(\\Theta\\), driven by the negative gradient of a potential \\( -J(\\theta)\\) plus noise\u2014exactly a dissipative flow.\n\n* **Full system:**  \n  The pair \\((s_t,\\theta_t)\\) forms a *coupled* nonlinear system.  \n  When learning is slow (\\(\\alpha_t\\to 0\\)), time-scale separation lets you treat \\(s_t\\) as fast, \\(\\theta_t\\) as slow; singular-perturbation methods then justify actor-critic ODEs.\n\n---\n\n#### Summary\n\nReinforcement learning can be formalized as a **random or deterministic difference/ differential equation on the product state space \\(\\mathcal S\\times\\Theta\\)**.  All standard dynamical-systems tools\u2014fixed points, Lyapunov functions, attractors, bifurcations, invariant measures\u2014apply directly, offering a rigorous bridge between RL and nonlinear dynamics."

              "Yes\u2014\u200bwith the right definitions that statement is mathematically sound and in fact underlies several canonical formulations of reinforcement-learning (RL) optimisation (e.g. the linear-programming view of Markov-decision-process control).  Below is a precise but compact unpacking.\n\n---\n\n### 1\u2003What are the two objects?\n\n| symbol | living space | meaning |\n|--------|--------------|---------|\n| \\(\\mu_\\pi\\) | \\(\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\) **or** trajectory space \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) | the probability **measure** induced by policy \\(\\pi\\) on states\u2013actions (discounted or average-time \u201coccupancy measure\u201d) |\n| \\(r\\) | same space | the **reward function**; equivalently a signed measure \\(r\\,\\lambda\\) if a base measure \\(\\lambda\\) is fixed |\n\n*If you prefer to speak of a \u201creward distribution\u201d, embed \\(r\\) into measure theory by taking the signed measure \\(d\\nu_r := r\\,d\\lambda\\); then \\(\\nu_r\\) and \\(\\mu_\\pi\\) live in the same Banach space of finite signed measures.*\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003Inner product = Expected return  \n\nChoose any reference measure \\(\\lambda\\) dominating both objects (counting measure on a finite space, or Lebesgue \u00d7 counting, etc.) and write the Radon\u2013Nikodym derivatives  \n\n\\[\nf_\\pi := \\frac{d\\mu_\\pi}{d\\lambda},\\quad  \ng := \\frac{dr}{d\\lambda}=r .\n\\]\n\nThe natural \\(L^2(\\lambda)\\) inner product gives  \n\n\\[\n\\langle \\mu_\\pi,\\;r\\,\\lambda\\rangle\n\\;=\\;\\int g\\,f_\\pi\\,d\\lambda\n\\;=\\;\\int r(x)\\,d\\mu_\\pi(x)\n\\;=\\;\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mu_\\pi}[\\,r(x)\\,],\n\\]\n\ni.e. the usual expected (discounted or average) reward.  So *maximising that inner product is exactly the classical RL objective*.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Why it is a faithful formulation\n\n1. **Linearity** \u2013 Optimising a linear functional on the convex set  \n   \\(\\{\\mu_\\pi : \\pi \\text{ admissible}\\}\\) puts RL into a convex-analysis framework; dynamic programming emerges as duality conditions for that linear programme.\n\n2. **Constraint separation** \u2013 All agent-induced randomness sits in \\(\\mu_\\pi\\); all task preferences sit in \\(r\\).  Analysis of one does not entangle the other.\n\n3. **Generalisability** \u2013  \n   *   **Risk-sensitive RL:** replace the inner product by a different functional (e.g. entropic, CVaR);  \n   *   **Multi-objective RL:** let \\(r\\) be vector-valued so the objective is \\(\\langle\\mu_\\pi, r_k\\rangle_{k=1}^K\\).  \n   The measure-based view still works.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Caveats and technical conditions\n\n| issue | required condition |\n|-------|--------------------|\n| Integrability | \\(r\\in L^1(\\mu_\\pi)\\) for every admissible \\(\\pi\\). True for bounded rewards. |\n| Existence of \\(\\mu_\\pi\\) | For discounted tasks: the discounted occupancy measure \\(d^\\pi_\\gamma\\) is always finite. For average-reward tasks: need ergodicity to obtain stationary distributions. |\n| Policy dependence | \\(\\mu_\\pi\\) is itself a function of \\(\\pi\\); optimisation is therefore *indirect* (constraints are Bellman flow constraints). |\n| Infinite horizon/trajectories | Work either in trajectory space with the product \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra, or fold the discount factor into \\(d^\\pi_\\gamma\\). |\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Relation to standard LP formulation of an MDP  \n\nFor a finite MDP with discount \\(\\gamma\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{\\mu \\ge 0}\\;\\;\\sum_{s,a} r(s,a)\\,\\mu(s,a) \\\\[2pt]\n&\\text{s.t. }  \n\\sum_a \\mu(s,a) = (1-\\gamma)\\,\\rho_0(s) + \\gamma\\sum_{s',a'} P(s|s',a')\\,\\mu(s',a'),\\;\\;\\forall s,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\rho_0\\) is the initial-state distribution.  \nHere \\(\\mu\\) is exactly the discounted occupancy measure; the objective row is the inner product \\(\\langle\\mu,r\\rangle\\).\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n\n**Yes.**  Saying \u201cthe agent\u2019s goal is to optimise the inner product of the measure it induces and the reward distribution\u201d is mathematically precise and recovers the classical expected-return objective as \\(\\displaystyle J(\\pi)=\\langle\\mu_\\pi,r\\rangle\\).  One just needs to specify:\n\n* the concrete form of \\(\\mu_\\pi\\) (discounted, average, finite-horizon trajectory, \u2026), and  \n* that \\(r\\) is regarded as a measurable function (or a signed measure absolutely continuous w.r.t. the same base measure).\n\nWith those in place the statement is not only valid; it is the foundational linear-functional view of RL optimisation."

We\u2019re dealing with a scenario where the gradient of the expected return changes over time due to the policy. Specifically, the REINFORCE algorithm updates the parameters \u03b8 via a gradient estimator. The system can be modeled as a differential equation, where \u03b8 changes in tandem with the environment\u2019s state. If \u03b1 is small enough, the environment\u2019s distribution stays consistent, effectively simplifying to an ODE that represents gradient ascent on J(\u03b8)."

At small values of \u03b1, the system behaves like a random dynamical system, but with a mean field approach, it becomes deterministic along the gradient. Stable points correspond to maxima, but saddle points can emerge. REINFORCE uses the sample-wise gradient estimator, creating stochastic behavior and \"noisy\" updates in \u03b8 as it climbs the gradient with random fluctuations."

              "Correct \u2014 my previous answer tacitly assumed that the phase-space density \\(\\rho\\) is twice continuously differentiable in a neighbourhood of each sampling point \\(x_i\\).  \nIf that smoothness fails, the Taylor expansion (and the conclusion that the Laplacian term is always negligible) can break down in three distinct ways:\n\n| scenario | local behaviour of \\(\\rho\\) near \\(x_i\\) | scaling of the cell-mass \\(p_i(\\varepsilon)=\\int_{C_i}\\rho\\) | impact on \\(D_q\\) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **(A) bounded Hessian** <br>(classical \\(C^2\\) case) | \\(|\\partial_{kk}\\rho|\\le M\\) | \\(p_i=\\rho(x_i)\\varepsilon^{d}+ \\dfrac{\\varepsilon^{d+2}}{24}\\,\\Delta\\rho(x_i)+\\dots\\) | the \\(\\varepsilon^{d+2}\\) term *always* vanishes in the \\(\\varepsilon\\!\\to\\!0\\) quotient, so \\(D_q=d\\) for every \\(q\\) (i.e. a smooth, full-dimensional measure). |\n| **(B) integrable but unbounded Laplacian** | \\(\\Delta\\rho(x)\\sim|x-x_i|^{-s},\\;0<s<2\\) | integrate in polar coords;<br>\\(\\displaystyle p_i=\\rho(x_i)\\varepsilon^{d}+c\\,\\varepsilon^{d+2-s}+o(\\varepsilon^{d+2-s})\\) | because \\(d+2-s>d\\), the singular Laplacian still decays faster than the leading term; the Taylor hierarchy survives and \\(D_q\\) is unchanged. |\n| **(C) non-integrable (distributional) second derivative** | e.g. a Dirac sheet: \\(\\Delta\\rho=\\sigma\\delta_{\\Sigma}\\) on a codimension-1 surface \\(\\Sigma\\) through \\(x_i\\) | by Green\u2019s identity, \\(\\displaystyle \\int_{C_i}\\!\\Delta\\rho=\\sigma\\,\\mathrm{Area}(C_i\\cap\\Sigma)\\sim\\sigma\\varepsilon^{d-1}\\) | now the \u201csecond-order\u2019\u2019 contribution falls only like \\(\\varepsilon^{d-1}\\); if \\(\\rho(x_i)=0\\) (as happens for singular invariant measures that are *not* absolutely continuous), this term *dominates* and changes the local scaling exponent: \\(\\alpha_i=d-1\\), which propagates into a non-trivial multifractal \\(D_q\\). |\n\n---\n\n### 1\u2003Why the Laplacian can \u201cblow up\u201d\n\nIn dissipative chaotic flows the natural (SRB) measure is typically **smooth along unstable directions but singular along stable ones**; projected onto the full phase space the density has delta-like sheets or filaments whose codimension equals the number of strongly contracting directions.  \nIn that situation \\(\\rho\\) is not even a function in the usual sense; it is an \\(L^1\\)-density only on unstable manifolds, and its second derivatives are distributions supported on a lower-dimensional set.  A cube centred on \\(x_i\\) that straddles such a sheet encloses mass that scales like the \\((d-1)\\)-dimensional area of the sheet cross-section, i.e. \\(\\varepsilon^{d-1}\\), not \\(\\varepsilon^d\\).  Consequently\n\n\\[\np_i(\\varepsilon)\\sim c(x_i)\\,\\varepsilon^{d-1},\\qquad\n\\alpha(x_i)=d-1,\n\\]\n\nand the local H\u00f6lder exponent \\(\\alpha(x_i)\\) enters the standard multifractal formula\n\n\\[\nD_q=\\frac{1}{q-1}\\inf_{\\alpha}\\bigl(q\\alpha-\\tau(\\alpha)\\bigr),\n\\]\nwith \\(\\tau(\\alpha)\\) the Legendre transform of the \\(f(\\alpha)\\) spectrum.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u2003When is it safe to drop the second-order term?\n\nA convenient sufficient condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\exists\\,\\eta>0\\text{ such that }|\\nabla^2\\rho(x)|\\le\nC|x-x_i|^{-d+\\eta}\\quad\\text{in a neighbourhood of }x_i.\n\\]\n\nThis ensures that \\(\\Delta\\rho\\) is locally integrable and the integral over a cube scales no faster than \\(\\varepsilon^{d+\\eta}\\) with \\(\\eta>0\\).  Then the \\(\\varepsilon^{d}\\) term always dominates.  In practice:\n\n* **Smooth invariant density** (e.g. Hamiltonian flow at equilibrium, or a noisy system with additive diffusion): condition holds; second-order can be ignored.\n* **Singular SRB density of a dissipative chaotic system**: condition fails on a set of positive measure in the support; one must abandon the Taylor expansion and treat the measure via its local scaling exponents instead.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Operational takeaway\n\n* If you **know** your \\(\\rho\\) is \\(C^2\\) (or at least \\(C^{1,1}\\)), centred cubes kill the linear term and the quadratic term is genuinely sub-leading; the R\u00e9nyi dimensions reduce to the embedding dimension \\(d\\).  \n* If \\(\\rho\\) is only \\(C^1\\) or worse, inspect the singular behaviour of \\(\\Delta\\rho\\).  The second-order term can contribute \\(\\varepsilon^{d-\\gamma}\\) with \\(\\gamma>0\\).  Whenever \\(\\gamma\\ge 1\\) and \\(\\rho(x_i)=0\\), that \u201chigher\u2019\u2019 order term dictates the scaling and must be kept.  \n* For truly fractal invariant measures it is usually better to **skip the Taylor route altogether** and estimate the local scaling of \\(p_i(\\varepsilon)\\) numerically; the resulting spectrum of exponents produces the full multifractal \\(D_q\\).\n\nSo the earlier remark \u201cthe second-order term never matters\u2019\u2019 is valid *only* under a smoothness hypothesis.  If the Laplacian diverges strongly enough, it can indeed supply the leading contribution to \\(p_i\\) and thereby alter the generalised dimensions."

To clarify, I\u2019ll show that the definitions align except for borderline cases. The key idea is that the sum of the first \"k\" exponents being non-negative means partial sums are positive. The largest \"k\" where this holds true ensures that adding the next exponent causes the sum to drop below zero, allowing for this distinction."

For example, if after including a weakly negative exponent the sum remains positive, then k increases by 1. The KY definition accounts for the cumulative sum, while my earlier intuition looks at individual exponents. This explains why the number of directions where stretching overcomes contraction differs, using the sum of exponents to compute dimensions."

For instance, a dissipative baker map with a constant Jacobian affects density through folding and merging of preimages. This causes variation in mass distribution. Multifractality happens because the counts of preimages grow exponentially, which changes density. The SRB measure comes from iterative applications of the transfer operator, and generalized dimensions reflect these different densities across multiple scales, as illustrated by simple models like the 1D logistic map."

Clumping likely relates to spreading density variations, while stress/strain tensors focus on local deformations. The Cauchy-Green strain tensor (C = J^T J) links to volume change, but clumping results from folding and overlapping material lines, not just local stretch. Strain captures local deformation, yet clumping is about global context, possibly involving preimages. It's a broader issue where behavior isn\u2019t solely described by local strain values like Lyapunov exponents."

              "Yes\u2014rewriting everything in terms of the **inverse Jacobian cocycle**\n\n\\[\nD\\Phi_{-t}(x)=\\bigl[D\\Phi_{t}\\bigl(\\Phi_{-t}x\\bigr)\\bigr]^{-1}\n\\]\n\nis perfectly legitimate and, in fact, is the standard \u201cbackward-in-time\u2019\u2019 way to express the weights that build up the SRB density.  The key facts to keep straight are:\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Single\u2013trajectory versus many\u2013to\u2013one piling-up  \n\nAlong one orbit \\(x(s)=\\Phi_s(x_0)\\)\n\n* the matrix \\(D\\Phi_{-t}(x(s))\\) tells you **how the ball sitting at \\(x(s)\\) right now looked \\(t\\) units *earlier*.**\n* its unstable determinant obeys  \n  \\[\n    \\bigl|\\det D\\Phi_{-t}^{\\,u}(x(s))\\bigr|\n    =\\exp\\!\\Bigl[-t\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\lambda_j\n         +o(t)\\Bigr],\n  \\]  \n  so a *single* orbit contributes the weight  \n  \\(\\bigl|\\det D\\Phi_{-t}^{\\,u}\\bigr|^{-1}\n  =\\exp\\!\\bigl[t\\sum_{j\\le k}\\lambda_j\\bigr]\\).\n\nBut the density at the current point \\(x(s)\\) is not that one contribution; it is the **sum over *all* backward branches** that arrive there after the repeated stretch\u2013and\u2013fold cycles.  You therefore need\n\n\\[\n\\rho_\\infty(x)\n\\;=\\;\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\;\n\\sum_{y:\\,\\Phi_t y = x}\n\\bigl|\\det D\\Phi_{-t}^{\\,u}(x)\\bigr|^{-1}\\,\\rho_0(y).\n\\tag{A}\n\\]\n\nFormula (A) expresses clumping entirely in terms of the inverse Jacobian *evaluated at the current point* \\(x\\); each backward branch contributes precisely one copy of that same matrix, and you add them up.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Relation to the transfer (Ruelle) operator  \n\nFor continuous-time flows, define the (backward) transfer operator acting on a test function \\(f\\):\n\n\\[\n(\\mathcal L_t f)(x)\n=\n\\sum_{y:\\,\\Phi_t y=x}\n\\frac{f(y)}{\\bigl|\\det D\\Phi_{t}(y)\\bigr|}\n=\n\\sum_{y:\\,\\Phi_t y=x}\nf(y)\\,\\bigl|\\det D\\Phi_{-t}(x)\\bigr|.\n\\]\n\nBecause every term in the second sum shares the **same** factor  \n\\(|\\det D\\Phi_{-t}(x)|\\), one often writes\n\n\\[\n(\\mathcal L_t f)(x)\n=\n\\bigl|\\det D\\Phi_{-t}(x)\\bigr|\n\\,\n\\sum_{y:\\,\\Phi_t y=x} f(y),\n\\tag{B}\n\\]\n\nwhich makes the two roles transparent:\n\n* **\\(\\det D\\Phi_{-t}\\)**\u2014local contraction/expansion of *any* pre-image once it arrives at \\(x\\);\n* **\\(\\sum\\)**\u2014how many distinct pre-images land at \\(x\\) (the clumping multiplicity).\n\nThe SRB density is the fixed point of \\(\\mathcal L_t\\); iterating (B) lets you compute it with nothing but inverse Jacobians.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Continuous version of the local dimension\n\nUsing the inverse cocycle you can write the pointwise (local) dimension field as\n\n\\[\nd_\\mu(x)\n=\nk\n\\;+\\;\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\n\\frac{1}{|\\lambda_{k+1}|\\,t}\\,\n\\log\\!\\Bigl[\n\\sum_{y:\\,\\Phi_t y=x}\n\\bigl|\\det D\\Phi_{-t}^{\\,u}(x)\\bigr|^{-1}\n\\Bigr].\n\\tag{C}\n\\]\n\n* The factor inside the \\(\\log\\) is the exact clumping weight defined in (A).  \n* The time average converts it into a continuous-time observable; Birkhoff\u2019s theorem guarantees the limit exists for \\(\\mu\\)-a.e. \\(x\\).\n\nIf the branching multiplicity were constant, the sum in (C) would collapse to one term and the local dimension would equal the Kaplan\u2013Yorke value everywhere; variability of that sum from point to point is precisely what makes the dimension (and therefore the multifractal spectrum) non-trivial.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Bottom line\n\n*Yes.*  All clumping information can be packaged into **inverse unstable determinants evaluated at the current point**, provided you remember to **sum over every backward branch**.  A single inverse Jacobian along one trajectory still tells you only its own local deformation; the multifractal geometry emerges when you aggregate those identical local weights over the exponentially many trajectories that are folded onto the same neighbourhood."

To clarify, k is defined as the largest integer such that the sum of the first k Lyapunov exponents is non-negative. This is the stable and neutral bundle's dimension. Regarding D_q, its range typically lies between k and k+1, meaning: k \u2264 D_q \u2264 k+1. We need to provide a mathematically rigorous yet concise explanation of this, including derivations of how this inequality holds."

The goal is to derive the relation between the determinant of the Jacobian of a flow map and the divergence function. This involves connecting the time derivative of the log of the Jacobian determinant to the trace (which involves divergence), and matching this with density variation. We also need to connect the product of eigenvalues to the determinant, showing it is inversely proportional to the density \\(\\rho\\). Let\u2019s break it down step by step."

              "Below is a compact derivation of the chain of identities you quoted, starting from the tangent-flow ODE and ending with the inverse-proportionality between the Jacobian determinant of the flow map and the transported density.  I keep the notation exactly as you wrote it, so \\(x(0)=x_0\\), \\(x(t)=\\Phi_t(x_0)\\), \\(J(t)=\\dfrac{\\partial \\Phi_t}{\\partial x_0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}\\), and \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) solves the Liouville/continuity equation.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Dynamics of the Jacobian matrix  \n\nFrom the linearised (tangent) system  \n\\[\n\\dot V(t)=\\bigl(\\nabla f\\bigl(x(t)\\bigr)\\bigr)\\,V(t),\\qquad V(0)=V_0,\n\\]  \npicking the \\(n\\) basis vectors \\(e_i\\) for \\(V_0\\) gives the matrix form\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\dot J(t)=\\nabla f\\bigl(x(t)\\bigr)\\,J(t)},\\qquad J(0)=I_n.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Time derivative of \\(\\det J(t)\\)\n\nUse **Jacobi\u2019s formula** for the derivative of a determinant:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\det J(t)=\\det J(t)\\,\\operatorname{Tr}\\!\\bigl(J(t)^{-1}\\dot J(t)\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(\\dot J(t)=\\nabla f\\,J(t)\\),\n\n\\[\nJ^{-1}\\dot J = J^{-1}\\bigl(\\nabla f\\,J\\bigr)=\\nabla f,\n\\]\n\nhence\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\det J(t)=\\det J(t)\\,\\operatorname{Tr}\\!\\bigl(\\nabla f\\bigl(x(t)\\bigr)\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nDivide by \\(\\det J(t)\\) (which stays non\u2013zero because \\(J(0)=I\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\frac{d}{dt}\\log\\det J(t)=\\operatorname{Tr}\\bigl(\\nabla f\\bigr)=\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\! f\\bigl(x(t)\\bigr)}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Transported density along the same path  \n\nFor the scalar density transported by the flow you already wrote\n\n\\[\n\\rho\\bigl(x(t),t\\bigr)=\\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\int_{0}^{t}\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\! f\\bigl(x(\\tau)\\bigr)\\,d\\tau\\Bigr)\\,\\rho\\bigl(x_0,0\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nMultiply the two exponentials:\n\n\\[\n\\det J(t)\\,\\rho\\bigl(x(t),t\\bigr)=\\rho\\bigl(x_0,0\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nIf the initial density \\(\\rho(\\cdot,0)\\) is spatially uniform (or if one simply tracks the ratio along a single trajectory) this gives the advertised inverse relation:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\\det J(t)=\\frac{\\rho(x_0,0)}{\\rho(x(t),t)}\\;\\propto\\;\\frac{1}{\\rho(x(t),t)}}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Determinant as product of eigenvalues  \n\nAt any fixed \\(t\\) the matrix \\(J(t)\\) has eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_i(t)\\).  By definition of the determinant,\n\n\\[\n\\det J(t)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\lambda_i(t).\n\\]\n\nCombining with the result of \u00a73 shows that the product of those eigenvalues evolves exactly as the exponential of the accumulated phase-space divergence, which is again the reciprocal of the density factor from \u00a74.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**\n\n* The flow Jacobian \\(J(t)\\) satisfies \\( \\dot J = (\\nabla f)\\,J \\).  \n* Jacobi\u2019s formula links \\(\\dot{\\det}J\\) to \\(\\operatorname{Tr}(\\nabla f)=\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!f\\).  \n* Integrating yields \\(\\det J(t)=\\exp\\!\\bigl(\\!\\int_0^t\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!f\\,d\\tau\\bigr)\\).  \n* The Liouville equation gives \\(\\rho(x(t),t)=\\rho(x_0,0)\\exp\\!\\bigl(-\\!\\int_0^t\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!f\\,d\\tau\\bigr)\\).  \n* Hence \\(\\det J(t)\\,\\rho(x(t),t)=\\rho(x_0,0)\\), so \\(\\det J\\propto1/\\rho\\).  \n* \\(\\det J=\\prod_i\\lambda_i\\) recasts the same fact in eigenvalue language.\n\nAll steps rely only on smoothness of \\(f\\) (so \\(\\nabla f\\) is continuous), invertibility of \\(J(t)\\) (automatic when the flow map is a local diffeomorphism), and the usual Jacobi formula."

Nothing says it must sit close to the identity, so the \u201csmall-strain\u201d expansions I wrote earlier are *not* meant to apply to the whole \\(J(t)\\) once \\(t\\) is appreciable.  Instead:\n\n| viewpoint | what is \u201csmall\u201d | where the previous first-order series is valid |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| continuum mechanics (single load step) | the displacement gradient \\(H=\\nabla u\\) | when we literally linearise a single deformation and assume \\(\\|H\\|\\ll1\\) |\n| dynamical systems (flow) | the **incremental** map over an infinitesimal time \\(dt\\) | \\(J(dt)=I+\\nabla f\\,dt+\\mathcal O(dt^{2})\\); those increments chain-multiply into the finite-time \\(J(t)\\) |\n\nSo the short-series argument *does* play a role, but only **locally in time**.  Stitching those local maps together produces the exact, possibly huge, finite-time \\(J(t)\\).\n\n---\n\n### Why we still like \\(\\varepsilon(t)=\\tfrac12\\log(J^{\\!\\top}J)\\)\n\n1. **Additivity in time.**  \n   Because \\(J(t+\\Delta t)=J(t+\\Delta t,t)\\,J(t)\\) and  \n   \\(\\log(J^{\\!\\top}J)\\) is additive after polar decomposition,\n   \\[\n        \\varepsilon(t+\\Delta t)=\n        \\varepsilon(t)+Q(t)\\,S\\bigl(x(t)\\bigr)\\,Q(t)^{\\!\\top}\\,\\Delta t+\\mathcal O\\!\\bigl((\\Delta t)^2\\bigr),\n   \\]\n   where \\(S=\\tfrac12\\bigl(\\nabla f+(\\nabla f)^{\\!\\top}\\bigr)\\).

Its eigenvalues go to the Lyapunov spectrum by Oseledets.\n\n2. **No need for smallness of \\(J\\).**  \n   The logarithm is defined for any positive-definite \\(J^{\\!\\top}J\\); it simply converts multiplicative growth into an additive record.  Even if \\(J\\) has singular values of order \\(e^{100}\\), \\(\\varepsilon\\) has eigenvalues of order \\(100\\).\n\n3. **Stable numerics.**  \n   QR-based algorithms essentially compute \\(\\varepsilon/t\\) incrementally, re-orthonormalising at every time step so the working matrices never blow up.\n\n---\n\n### Where \u201cfirst-order\u201d language belongs\n\n* **In continuum-mechanics prose**: \u201c\\(C\\) is quadratic, \\(\\varepsilon\\) is first-order\u201d means *first-order in the single-step displacement gradient*.\n* **In dynamical-systems prose**: each *infinitesimal* step contributes only first-order in \\(dt\\) to \\(\\varepsilon\\); summing those contributions over long times gives the exact finite-time \\(\\varepsilon(t)\\).  There is no analogous \u201cquadratic leftover\u201d because we never truncated the product.\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom line\n\n* \\(J(t)\\) itself is never treated as \u201csmall\u201d once \\(t\\) is finite.  \n* For Lyapunov analysis you use the **exact** tensors \\(C(t)=J^{\\!\\top}J\\) or \\(\\varepsilon(t)=\\tfrac12\\log C(t)\\).  \n* The earlier \u201cfirst-order\u201d remark applies only to the *local-in-time* generators \\(\\nabla f\\,dt\\); chaining those generates the full deformation without approximation."

              "### Intuition in one sentence  \nA **covariant Lyapunov vector** (CLV) picks an infinitesimal displacement that, when you push it forward with the flow, never swivels into a new direction\u2014its only change is a uniform stretch or squeeze governed by its Lyapunov exponent.\n\n---\n\n## 1  How that differs from other \u201cLyapunov vectors\u201d\n\n| Tangent vector family | What the flow does to it over \\(\\Delta t\\) | Orthogonal? | Direction after many steps |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|\n| **Right singular vectors** of \\(J\\) or QR basis | Stretch + **may rotate** into the next QR column | Yes | Drifts as QR is recomputed |\n| **CLVs** | Stretch (factor \\(e^{\\lambda_i\\Delta t}\\)) **with no rotation** | No | Stays *exactly* aligned with itself at all times |\n\n---\n\n## 2  Geometric picture\n\n1. Take a tiny sphere of initial perturbations at \\(x_0\\).  \n2. After time \\(t\\) the sphere becomes an ellipsoid whose axes are the singular vectors of \\(J(t)\\). But that ellipsoid itself has usually rotated relative to the original frame.  \n3. A **CLV** chooses one material line inside that ellipsoid such that each time you advect it, the line maps into itself\u2014only longer or shorter. In other words, the flow\u2019s linear part acts on that vector like simple scalar multiplication.\n\n> **Analogy:** Think of painting arrows on a rubber sheet. Most arrows twist and stretch as you deform the sheet. A CLV arrow is painted in a \u201cprincipal direction\u201d of the sheet so that when you pull the sheet again it merely lengthens or shortens but never swings toward a new heading.\n\n---\n\n## 3  Formal statement\n\nFor the propagator \\(\\mathcal L_{t,s}\\),\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal L_{t,s}\\,v_i(x_s)=e^{\\lambda_i(t-s)}\\,v_i(x_t),\n\\]\n\nso the vector *co*-varies (transforms proportionally) with the map rather than contra-variantly (rotating away).  \u201cNo rotation\u201d is exact: the result is always a parallel copy of the original vector in the updated tangent space.\n\n---\n\n## 4  What information CLVs convey\n\n* **Local unstable/stable directions.**  The first CLV (\\(\\lambda_1>0\\)) points where perturbations explode fastest; the last one (\\(\\lambda_n<0\\)) points where they die the quickest.\n* **Hyperbolicity check.**  The angle between the expanding and contracting CLVs diagnoses whether stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversely.\n* **Symmetry generators.**  Zero exponents yield CLVs that align with continuous symmetries (time shift, translations, rotations) of the system.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \nYes\u2014CLVs are precisely those infinitesimal perturbations whose *direction* is immune to the flow\u2019s shearing and twisting; they only dilate or contract, at an exponential rate equal to their Lyapunov exponent."

In simple terms, the vector with the largest exponent dominates the direction of growth, but other CLVs still play a role. These secondary vectors describe growth in directions orthogonal to the dominant one, like the way the Gram-Schmidt process works. Oseledets' theorem explains that even the second-largest exponent can influence growth once the dominant direction is removed. This helps us understand how systems expand or contract in various directions."

Since \"Asymptotic Lenia\" is a specific term, it\u2019s right to capitalize both parts. Overall, the title mostly follows the rules, but the minor words might need adjusting."

Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan-Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n% Choose one of: Full Paper, Summaries, or Late Breaking Abstracts \nSubmission type: \\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\n\n% If sharing code / data, anonymize your repository and paste the link here.\n% Example of anonymizing sevice for github: https://anonymous.4open.science/\n% delete this line if not needed\nData/Code available at: \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DynamicalCA-78B8/README.md}\n\n\\section{Background}\\label{sec:background}\n\n\\subsection{Continuous Cellular Automata}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\n    \\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, which exist in distinct regions of the PDE's parameter space. The \\textit{soliton} is a stable, purely translating solution. The \\textit{rotator} is a stable, purely rotating solution. The \\textit{periodic soliton} is a translating solution which also oscillates periodically. The \\textit{chaotic soliton} exhibits a chaotic combination of translations, rotations, and internal oscillations.}\n    \\label{fig:lenia_zoo}\n\\end{figure}\n\nContinuous cellular automata (CCAs) were initially invented to recreate the complex emergent behavior of the program known as Conway's Game of Life \\citep{Gardner1970}, with the hope of finding more life-like patterns. In the search for complexity, CAs gradually evolved towards a pure (non-local) partial differential equation (PDE) formulation. ``Larger than life'' \\citep{Evans2001} increased the size of the kernel, SmoothLife \\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, Lenia \\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally Asymptotic Lenia \\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this total transition from lookup table to PDE, the methods for analyzing these systems have seen very little progress. As a result, the field has largely retained the intuition that emergent complexity has no simple causal explanation.\n\nIn this paper, we show that transitioning to a PDE model of CCAs allows us to import well-established mathematical concepts from dynamical systems theory. We first introduce the main concepts: symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimension, and more. Using these concepts, we establish a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure the relevant quantities to obtain a complete characterization of the complexity of solutions. Finally, we suggest a specific quantity for measuring complexity in CCAs and summarize the small set of key properties which are sufficient for a broader class of CCAs to exhibit complex behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\n\nOur analysis centers around the Asymptotic Lenia system since it is the only CCA discovered thus far that is defined as a continuous PDE \\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions to the PDE are shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\citet{alenia2021} as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\mathbf{F}(A,K*A) = T(K*A) - A, \\label{asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $A \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued 2-D scalar field, $K \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ is the 2-D convolution operator, and $T \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function, applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}(u-\\mu)^2/\\sigma^2)$ is parameterized by $0<\\sigma \\ll \\mu$, and is typically approximated via a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\mathbf{x})=K(\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2)$ is composed of a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r)=(4r(r-1))^4$ with parameters $\\{\\beta_i\\}$ controlling the scaling of the rings, and $R$ controlling the overall spatial scale. Importantly, $K(0)=0$ and $K$ is normalized such that $\\int_{\\Omega} K(\\mathbf{x})\\,d\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume that the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe also define the spatially-discretized version of Asymptotic Lenia, which is a finite-dimensional (ODE) approximation of the PDE, and is closer to the true numerical implementation of the system. At each discrete point in space $(i,j) \\in [0,N-1]^2$, we define a function of time $A[i,j](t)\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The field's dynamics are given by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d}{dt} A[i,j](t) = \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right) - A[i,j]. \\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\n\nTo analyze Asymptotic Lenia, we seek a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of fields---functions of space---over time. This is the subject of the theory of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. In this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to the finite-dimensional setting because it makes our results easier to follow, without loss of generality. A fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment of CCAs is beyond the scope of this paper, but we do borrow one important concept: symmetry.\n\nA \\textit{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions \\citep{Olver1986}. If the transformation depends on a single continuous parameter (e.g. a shift by $\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is called a \\textit{continuous symmetry}. Continuous symmetries can be organized into a \\textit{Lie group}. An example of a Lie group is the set of rotations and translations on a 2-D plane $SE(2)$. The associated set of infinitesimal transformations is called the \\textit{Lie algebra} and it is composed of the \\textit{generators} of the group. For example, the generators for translation in the $x$-direction is $\\partial_x$ and the generator for rotation is $x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x$. All 2-D CCAs are invariant under the action of the group $SE(2)$ because the update rule is identical across all of space, and the non-local component is only a function of radial distance. They are also invariant under time translation since the update rule is autonomous, meaning it is independent of time.\n\nNow, we describe the finite-dimensional setting for dynamical systems theory in the language of \\citep[e.g.,][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}. The definitions are mapped to discretized Asymptotic Lenia as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{Phase Space}: $\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$: The set of all possible states of the system. \n    \\item \\textit{Evolution Law}: $\\dot A(t)=\\mathbf{F}(A)$: The system of ODEs that describes the evolution of the state over time.\n    \\item \\textit{Semiflow} $\\Phi_t(A(0))=A(t),t\\ge 0$: The map that takes an initial state $A(0)$ and a time $t$ to the future state $A(t)$. Its existence is guaranteed because $\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous and $|A|$ can never blow up in finite time \\citep{Robinson2001}\\footnote{The rigorous proof is omitted. The Lipschitz property follows from that fact that $K*A$ is bounded and $T$ is Lipschitz. $|A|$ is bounded because it can at most grow/shrink exponentially.}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWith the above definitions in place, we can discuss the following properties of the dynamical system.\n\n\\textit{Dissipativity}: A semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative if there exists a bounded set $\\mathcal{B} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every initial condition $A(0)\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is absorbed into $\\mathcal{B}$ in a finite time $t^*$.\n\n\\textit{Global Attractor}: If a semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative, then there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ which is the minimal set onto which all trajectories converge as $t\\to\\infty$. The attractor entirely contains the long-term behavior of the system after transients have died away. A global attractor also guarantees at least one invariant measure on the attractor, letting us take physically meaningful integrals over the attractor. \n\n\\textit{Fractal Dimension}: Dissipative chaotic dynamical systems tend to settle to attractors which integrate to zero phase space volume but cannot be represented as an integer-dimensional manifold. These are called fractal attractors, and they are characterized by their fractal dimension. Fractal dimension approximately represents the number of degrees of freedom in a given set, and there are several relevant definitions for fractal dimension. We focus on specific cases of the generalized dimensions introduced by \\citet{Grassberger1983}. They are defined as:\n\n\\[\nD_q = \\frac{1}{1-q} \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\frac{\\log (\\sum_{i} p_i^q)}{\\log (1/\\varepsilon)},\n\\]\n\n\\noindent where $p_i$ is the total mass in the $i$-th box in a uniform partition of phase space with some resolution $\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\textit{box-counting dimension}, $D_1$ is the \\textit{information dimension}, and $D_2$ is the \\textit{correlation dimension}. These only differ when the distribution of density on the attractor is non-uniform.\n\n\\textit{Lyapunov Exponents}: The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are defined as the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. If there exists at least one positive Lyapunov exponent, then we call the system chaotic because nearby trajectories exponentially diverge. There exist several definitions for LEs (see \\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020} for a comprehensive overview), but the one that applies best to our setting is: \n\\[\n\\lambda_i(A(0))=\\limsup_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\log \\sigma_i(A(0),t),\n\\]\n\\noindent where $\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\nabla_A \\Phi_t(A)$. These exponents can be approximated numerically using the method presented by \\citet{Benettin1980}. Furthermore, the covariant Lyapunov vectors, which encode the associated perturbation directions for each exponent, can be calculated easily with a short backwards pass after applying Benettin's method \\citep{Ginelli2007}.\n\n\\textit{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension}: The Kaplan-Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ is a heuristic upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor. Experimentally, it has been shown to closely estimate $D_1$, except in rare edge cases (see discussion in \\citep{Groger2013}). It is defined as\n\\[\nD_{KY}=j + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^j \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{j+1}|},\n\\]\n\\noindent where $j$ is the largest index such that the cumulative sum of the largest $j$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative.\n\n\\section{Mathematical Results}\n\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\n\nAs explained in the Background section, \\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the action of the group $G=SE(2)\\times\\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding Lie algebra is:\n\\[\n\\mathfrak g=\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb R}\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y, x\\partial_y-y\\partial_x, \\partial_t\\}\n\\]\n\nUsing these symmetries, we can derive conditions under which specific forms of solutions exist. We refer to these as \\textit{symmetry solutions}, and we can express them with the ansatz $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0$, where $\\gamma \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ and $A_0=A(\\mathbf{x},0)$. This ansatz becomes a solution when the following equation is satisfied:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\partial_t\\left[e^{t \\gamma} A_0\\right] &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, K * (e^{t \\gamma} A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma\\,e^{t \\gamma} A_0                &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, e^{t \\gamma}(K*A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\gamma A_0                &= e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma A_0                              &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\label{stationary_cond}\n\\end{align}\n\nFrom the second to third line, we use the $G$-equivariance property of $\\mathbf{F}$. We also use the fact that $e^{t\\gamma}$ commutes with $\\gamma$ and $K$ and has an inverse operator $e^{-t\\gamma}$. These facts are not trivial and are a direct consequence of the specific form of the PDE. \n\nA key result of \\eqref{stationary_cond} is that no evolution is required to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{v}t,0)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0,\\,\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we need only find an initial field $A_0$ such that \\eqref{stationary_cond} is satisfied with $\\gamma=-\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}\\partial_x\\,\\, \\partial_y\\end{bmatrix}^\\top$. A similar argument applies to rotating solutions and steady state solutions. Note that since $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{0}, K*\\mathbf{0})=\\mathbf{0}$, a trivial solution to \\eqref{stationary_cond} always exists. \n\nThere is also an important connection between the Lie algebra and the Lyapunov exponents of the system. Theorem 2.15 of \\citet{Aston1994} showed that for $G$-equivariant flows, the number of Lyapunov exponents equal to zero is $\\dim\\{G\\} - \\dim\\{g \\in G\\,|\\,g\\!\\cdot\\!A=A\\}$. In our case, the number of zero exponents equals 4 minus the number of independent continuous symmetries that leave the solution unchanged. For example, a purely translating solution will have at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents because one dimension of the symmetry group (corresponding to translation in the direction of motion combined with an appropriate time shift) acts trivially on the solution.\n\n\\subsection{Dissipativity and Existence of a Global Attractor}\n\nIn this section, we prove a fundamental property of Asymptotic Lenia: all trajectories remain bounded within a finite region of phase space and eventually converge to a common attractor. This property, known as dissipativity, is crucial for understanding the long-term behavior of the system and ensures that the complexity we observe is constrained within a well-defined mathematical structure.\n\nUsing the formal definition from \\cite{Robinson2001}, we can show that discretized Asymptotic Lenia is a dissipative semiflow.  For some $\\varepsilon > 0$, consider the compact set $\\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon=[0-\\varepsilon,1+\\varepsilon]^{N^2} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$, $M(t)=\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. If we choose the initial condition $A[i,j](0)\\in \\mathcal{X}$ and assume $0\\le T(\\cdot)\\le 1$, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{dM}{dt} &= T((K*A)[i_M,j_M]) - M \\le 1 - M \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies M(t) \\le 1 + \\bigl(M(0)-1\\bigr)e^{-t} \\\\[8pt]\n    \\frac{dm}{dt} &= T((K*A)[i_m,j_m]) - m \\ge -m \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies m(t) \\ge m(0)\\,e^{-t}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\noindent where $(i_M,j_M)$ and $(i_m,j_m)$ are the indices of the maximum and minimum values of $A[i,j](t)$ respectively. Therefore, after a finite time\n\n\\[\nt^*= \\max\\left\\{\\ln\\left|\\frac{M(0)-1}{\\varepsilon}\\right|, \\ln\\left|\\frac{m(0)}{\\varepsilon}\\right|\\right\\},\n\\]\nwe must have $A[i,j](t)\\in \\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon,\\, \\forall\\, t \\ge t^*$. We conclude that there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$. A very similar argument can be used to show that the full PDE is also dissipative, but this is not necessary for our purposes. We can now inquire about the kinds of behavior we expect to see on the attractor. \n\n\\subsection{Helmholtz Decomposition and Behavior on the Attractor}\n\nIn this section, we analyze the mathematical structure of the Asymptotic Lenia dynamics to understand why it can produce complex behaviors such as chaos and periodic oscillations. We show that the system can be decomposed into two fundamental components: a divergence-free (rotational) part and a gradient part. This decomposition, known as the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, reveals why Asymptotic Lenia can exhibit rich dynamics rather than simply settling into static patterns. We start by calculating the Jacobian of $\\mathbf{F}$ from \\eqref{discrete_asymptotic_lenia} as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)}{\\partial A[k,l]} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[k,l]} \\left[T((K*A)[i,j]) - A[i,j]\\right]\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, \\frac{\\partial (K*A)[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]} -  \\frac{\\partial A[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]}\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, K[i-k,j-l] - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}\n\\end{align*}\n\nImposing $K[0,0]=0$, the divergence of the first term becomes zero so the divergence comes entirely from summing the Kronecker delta terms, giving $\\nabla_A \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = -N^2$. This means that we can write $\\mathbf{F}$ as the sum of a divergence-free term and a term which is the gradient of a scalar potential:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = \\underbrace{T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right)}_{\\text{divergence-free}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[i,j]} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,l} A^2[k,l]\\right]}_{\\text{gradient}}\n\\]\n\nSuch a decomposition is known as a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition \\citep{hhd2013}. We do not comment on the uniqueness of the decomposition due to the possibility for harmonic components, but we can infer that $\\mathbf{F}$ cannot be the gradient of a scalar function. This is because for any arbitrary pair of indices $(i,j)\\ne (k,l)$, the entries of the Jacobian are not necessarily equal due to nonlinearity of $T$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/lyap.png}\n    \\caption{Lyapunov spectra of the four classes of solutions shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.

While trajectories of a pure gradient flow are not guaranteed to reach a steady state, they are guaranteed to enter and remain in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the set of steady states \\citep{Hale1988,Robinson2001}. The classic neighbor-sum + non-linearity rule turns out to be exactly the right kind of term to allow for complex behavior.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/clv.png}\n    \\caption{Covariant Lyapunov vectors of the chaotic soliton.

The top 10 CLVs are visualized on the right, where blue and red correspond to negative and positive values respectively.}\n    \\label{fig:clv}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Experimental Results}\n\nHaving established the theoretical framework for analyzing Asymptotic Lenia, we now empirically measure key quantities to characterize the complexity of different solution classes. Our theoretical analysis predicted that chaotic solutions should exhibit a global attractor with fractal dimension between 4 and $N^2$, with the exact dimension reflecting the system's complexity. Here, we verify these predictions by calculating LEs and the corresponding Kaplan-Yorke dimension for representative solutions from each class identified in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.\n\nLEs are calculated for the spatially-discretized flow using the method first proposed by \\citet{Benettin1980}. In particular, we integrate a set of $k$ orthogonal vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ along the linearized flow $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_i=\\nabla_A \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{v}_i$ and repeatedly apply QR decomposition to ensure orthogonality. \\citet{Benettin1980} showed that the top $k$ exponents equal the time average of the logarithmic growth of the tangent vectors' norms between successive applications of QR decomposition. These top $k$ LEs can then be plugged into the Kaplan-Yorke formula to obtain an upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra for four distinct solution classes are shown in \\cref{fig:lyap_spectrum}. We calculate these with a spatial discretization of $N=256$ and a time step of $\\Delta t=0.1$. After an initial transient period, we run a forward pass for 100,000 steps and then a backwards pass for 10,000 steps to calculate the LEs and CLVs. Since the tangent vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ are initialized randomly and take time to converge, we only average over the last 50,000 steps to obtain the finite-time LEs.\n\nAs predicted, the purely rotating and translating solutions have 3 zero LEs, while the chaotic and periodic solutions have 4 zero LEs. Intuitively, in all but the chaotic case, the top LEs are all zero, making $D_{KY}$ exactly equal to the number of zero LEs. When the top LEs are all close to zero, the $D_{KY}$ formula is sensitive to tiny differences in the values, so in practice we round all $|\\lambda_i|<0.001$ to zero. For the chaotic soliton, we found that it had a Kaplan-Yorke dimension of approximately 8.46, with two significant positive LEs.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra help explain the remarkable robustness to perturbation we observe in practice. Since all but a few of the $N^2$ LEs are negative (with a mean of -1), the system exponentially decays most modes of a random perturbation. In \\cref{fig:clv}, we visualize the unstable, neutral, and stable modes by calculating the covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) for the chaotic soliton. It is important to note that the CLVs are not necessarily orthogonal, and in this case they certainly are not. We also observe that within the set of neutral CLVs, $\\lambda_4$ and $\\lambda_6$ are approximately identical. This is because they theoretically correspond to the same exponent so the CLVs span a degenerate subspace that has no unique decomposition \\citep{Ginelli2013}.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nIn the previous section, we verified that the number of zero LEs matched the theoretically predicted quantity and that chaotic patterns indeed exhibit at least one positive LE and $D_{KY}>4$. The calculation of the LEs was relatively computationally inexpensive and the results were easy to interpret. Compared to other methods of estimating fractal dimension, this ``Lyapunov analysis'' is uniquely effective for reasons we will discuss next.\n\n\\subsection{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension as a Measure of Complexity}\nBoth the box-counting dimension and correlation dimension are impractical measures of fractal dimension for finely discretized PDEs. Box-counting dimension requires constructing histograms with $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-N^2})$ bins, where $\\varepsilon$ is the bin size. Correlation dimension requires calculating the pairwise distance between all sampled fields $A[i,j](n\\Delta t)$ on a trajectory, which is expensive but tractable for moderate $N$ and trajectory lengths. However, convergence is slow because the method relies on sampling many points from the tail of the power-law distance distribution. Experimentally, we also found that log-log plots of the pairwise distance distribution did not have a uniquely identifiable linear region, making the correlation dimension difficult to interpret unambiguously. On the other hand, the Kaplan-Yorke dimension requires just a constant number of Jacobian-vector product operations and QR decompositions to be carried out at each timestep of the state evolution. Even for chaotic attractors, we found in our experiments that convergence to within 1\\% of the long-time estimate of $D_{KY}$ required only $\\sim 10^4$ timesteps at $\\Delta t=0.1$. \n\nAdditionally, information dimension (upper bounded by $D_{KY}$) offers the most intuitive interpretation of fractal dimension. It tells us how many bits of information are needed to describe any state on the attractor for a given resolution. Equivalently, we can think of information dimension as answering \\textit{how many real numbers are needed to encode the state} as opposed to how many binary numbers---i.e. entropy. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is the most practical and informative measure of complexity for Continuous Cellular Automata. \n\nWe suggest that future works on Continuous and Neural CAs use $D_{KY}$ to quantify the complexity of patterns they discover. Next, we discuss how we can systematically search for higher complexity in CCAs.\n\n\\subsection{Generalizing CCAs}\nWe begin by summarizing the mathematical predictions, and the minimal assumptions from which we derived them. This is shown in \\cref{tab:assumptions} below.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\\linewidth}p{0.5\\linewidth}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Assumption} & \\textbf{Resulting Prediction} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\partial_t A =T(K*A)-A$,\\newline $K$ radially symmetric. & Possibility of symmetry solutions and up to four $\\lambda_i=0$. \\\\\n\\midrule\n$0 \\le T(\\cdot) \\le 1$,\\newline $T$ Lipschitz continuous & Existence of global attractor. \\\\ \n\\midrule\n$K[0,0] = 0$ & $\\dim \\mathcal{A} < N^2$. Not a gradient flow, possibility of dynamic attractors. \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Summary of key assumptions and their mathematical implications for Asymptotic Lenia dynamics.}\n\\label{tab:assumptions}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe listed assumptions alone do not guarantee the existence of a chaotic attractor. However, we know that at least one choice of $T$ and $K$ satisfying the assumptions does produce a chaotic attractor because Asymptotic Lenia is a known example. We also know that Asymptotic Lenia does not span the entire set of such CCAs. The parameterization of $T$ and $K$ via the parameter set $\\{\\mu, \\sigma\\}\\cup \\{\\beta_i\\}$ is just one low-dimensional parameterization of the space of functions satisfying the listed assumptions. \n\nWe could stop there, and suggest that there are many other forms of $T$ and $K$ which exhibit similar kinds of chaotic behavior. However, we aim to find a broader class of CCAs which might exhibit new types of complex behavior like replication, reproduction, or goal-directedness. We suggest that the following general formulation of CCAs be explored in future work:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = f(K*A) - \\nabla_A G(A),\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $K$ is bounded, radially symmetric, and zero at the origin, and $f$ is a Lipschitz continuous nonlinear function such that $0 \\le f(\\cdot) \\le 1$. If we require $G$ be a convex function with no minimizers outside $[0,1]^{N^2}$ and $\\nabla_A G(\\mathbf{1}) \\ge \\mathbf{1}$, we can guarantee both dissipativity and nonpositive divergence. This follows from a similar argument to the one made in the mathematical results section, but we omit the proof. In this formulation, the divergence is still negative since it is the Laplacian of a convex function, but it will also be nonuniform over the phase space. We suspect that nonuniform divergence may be enough for highly multifractal attractors to emerge, leading to novel forms of complexity.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have shown that the mathematical framework of dynamical systems theory can be rigorously applied to Asymptotic Lenia, and that it provides a powerful set of tools for understanding complexity in a broader class of CCAs. We introduced Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension as fundamental concepts and provided a simple open-source implementation of the algorithm used to calculate them. This allowed us to experimentally verify that just a few key properties of the system are sufficient to enable chaotic behavior. Using these properties, we proposed a generalization of CCAs which we believe may contain new forms of complexity which cannot be characterized by a single Lyapunov spectrum.\n\nFor future work, we suggest that the full infinite-dimensional dynamical systems framework be applied to our general CCA formulation. In particular, we are very interested in an extended theoretical framework which could explain and predict phenomena like replication, reproduction, and goal-directedness. We also strongly encourage future works in continuous-time artificial life simulations like neural cellular automata to quantify the complexity of their systems using the Lyapunov analysis presented here.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}Support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number [anonymized number] is gratefully acknowledged.\nCette recherche a \\'et\\'e financ\\'ee par le Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en g\\'enie du Canada (CRSNG), num\\'ero de r\\'ef\\'erence [anonymized number].

Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan-Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source  implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n% Choose one of: Full Paper, Summaries, or Late Breaking Abstracts \nSubmission type: \\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\n\n% If sharing code / data, anonymize your repository and paste the link here.\n% Example of anonymizing sevice for github: https://anonymous.4open.science/\n% delete this line if not needed\nData/Code available at: \\url{http://will.add.later}\n\n\\section{Background}\\label{sec:background}\n\n\\subsection{Continuous Cellular Automata}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\n    \\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, which exist in distinct regions of the PDE's parameter space. The \\textit{soliton} is a stable, purely translating solution. The \\textit{rotator} is a stable, purely rotating solution. The \\textit{periodic soliton} is a translating solution which also oscillates periodically. The \\textit{chaotic soliton} exhibits a chaotic combination of translations, rotations, and internal oscillations.}\n    \\label{fig:lenia_zoo}\n\\end{figure}\n\nContinuous cellular automata (CCAs) were initially invented to recreate the complex emergent behavior of the program known as Conway's Game of Life \\citep{Gardner1970}, with the hope of finding more life-like patterns. In the search for complexity, CAs gradually evolved towards a pure (non-local) partial differential equation (PDE) formulation. Larger-than-life \\citep{Evans2001} increased the size of the kernel, SmoothLife \\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, Lenia \\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally Asymptotic Lenia \\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this total transition from lookup table to PDE, the methods for analyzing these systems have seen very little progress. As a result, the field has largely retained the intuition that emergent complexity has no simple causal explanation.\n\nIn this paper, we show that transitioning to a PDE model of CCAs allows us to import well-established mathematical concepts from dynamical systems theory. We first introduce the main concepts: symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimension, and more. Using these concepts, we establish a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure the relevant quantities to obtain a complete characterization of the complexity of solutions. Finally, we suggest a specific quantity for measuring complexity in CCAs and summarize the small set of key properties which are sufficient for a broader class of CCAs to exhibit complex behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\n\nOur analysis centers around the Asymptotic Lenia system since it is the only CCA discovered thus far that is defined as a continuous PDE \\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions to the PDE are shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\citet{alenia2021} as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\mathbf{F}(A,K*A) = T(K*A) - A, \\label{asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $A \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued 2-D scalar field, $K \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ is the 2-D convolution operator, and $T \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function, applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}(u-\\mu)^2/\\sigma^2)$ is parameterized by $0<\\sigma \\ll \\mu$, and is typically approximated via a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\mathbf{x})=K(\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2)$ is composed of a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r)=(4r(r-1))^4$ with parameters $\\{\\beta_i\\}$ controlling the scaling of the rings, and $R$ controlling the overall spatial scale. Importantly, $K(0)=0$ and $K$ is normalized such that $\\int_{\\Omega} K(\\mathbf{x})\\,d\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume that the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe also define the spatially-discretized version of Asymptotic Lenia, which is a finite-dimensional (ODE) approximation of the PDE, and is closer to the true numerical implementation of the system. At each discrete point in space $(i,j) \\in [0,N-1]^2$, we define a function of time $A[i,j](t)\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The field's dynamics are given by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d}{dt} A[i,j](t) = \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right) - A[i,j]. \\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\n\nTo analyze Asymptotic Lenia, we seek a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of fields---functions of space---over time. This is the subject of the theory of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. In this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to the finite-dimensional setting because it makes our results easier to follow, without loss of generality. A fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment of CCAs is beyond the scope of this paper, but we do borrow one important concept: symmetry.\n\nA \\textit{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions \\citep{Olver1986}. If the transformation depends on a single continuous parameter (e.g. a shift by $\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is called a \\textit{continuous symmetry}. Continuous symmetries can be organized into a \\textit{Lie group}. An example of a Lie group is the set of rotations and translations on a 2-D plane $SE(2)$. The associated set of infinitesimal transformations is called the \\textit{Lie algebra} and it is composed of the \\textit{generators} of the group. For example, the generators for translation in the $x$-direction is $\\partial_x$ and the generator for rotation is $x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x$. All 2-D CCAs are invariant under the action of the group $SE(2)$ because the update rule is identical across all of space, and the non-local component is only a function of radial distance. They are also invariant under time translation since the update rule is autonomous, meaning it is independent of time.\n\nNow, we describe the finite-dimensional setting for dynamical systems theory in the language of \\citep[e.g.,][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}. The definitions are mapped to discretized Asymptotic Lenia as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{Phase Space}: $\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$: The set of all possible states of the system. \n    \\item \\textit{Evolution Law}: $\\dot A(t)=\\mathbf{F}(A)$: The system of ODEs that describes the evolution of the state over time.\n    \\item \\textit{Semiflow} $\\Phi_t(A(0))=A(t),t\\ge 0$: The map that takes an initial state $A(0)$ and a time $t$ to the future state $A(t)$. Its existence is guaranteed because $\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous and $|A|$ can never blow up in finite time \\citep{Robinson2001}\\footnote{The rigorous proof is omitted. The Lipschitz property follows from that fact that $K*A$ is bounded and $T$ is Lipschitz. $|A|$ is bounded because it can at most grow/shrink exponentially.}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWith the above definitions in place, we can discuss the following properties of the dynamical system.\n\n\\textit{Dissipativity}: A semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative if there exists a bounded set $\\mathcal{B} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every initial condition $A(0)\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is absorbed into $\\mathcal{B}$ in a finite time $t^*$.\n\n\\textit{Global Attractor}: If a semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative, then there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ which is the minimal set onto which all trajectories converge as $t\\to\\infty$. The attractor entirely contains the long-term behavior of the system after transients have died away. A global attractor also guarantees at least one invariant measure on the attractor, letting us take physically meaningful integrals over the attractor. \n\n\\textit{Fractal Dimension}: Dissipative chaotic dynamical systems tend to settle to attractors which integrate to zero phase space volume but cannot be represented as an integer-dimensional manifold. These are called fractal attractors, and they are characterized by their fractal dimension. Fractal dimension approximately represents the number of degrees of freedom in a given set, and there are several relevant definitions for fractal dimension. We focus on specific cases of the generalized dimensions introduced by \\citet{Grassberger1983}. They are defined as:\n\n\\[\nD_q = \\frac{1}{1-q} \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\frac{\\log (\\sum_{i} p_i^q)}{\\log (1/\\varepsilon)},\n\\]\n\n\\noindent where $p_i$ is the total mass in the $i$-th box in a uniform partition of phase space with some resolution $\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\textit{box-counting dimension}, $D_1$ is the \\textit{information dimension}, and $D_2$ is the \\textit{correlation dimension}. These only differ when the distribution of density on the attractor is non-uniform.\n\n\\textit{Lyapunov Exponents}: The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are defined as the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. If there exists at least one positive Lyapunov exponent, then we call the system chaotic because nearby trajectories exponentially diverge. There exist several definitions for LEs (see \\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020} for a comprehensive overview), but the one which applies best to our setting is: \n\\[\n\\lambda_i(A(0))=\\limsup_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\log \\sigma_i(A(0),t),\n\\]\n\\noindent where $\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\nabla_A \\Phi_t(A)$. These exponents can be approximated numerically using the method presented by \\citet{Benettin1980}. Furthermore, the covariant Lyapunov vectors, which encode the associated perturbation directions for each exponent, can be calculated easily with a short backwards pass after applying Benettin's method \\citep{Ginelli2007}.\n\n\\textit{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension}: The Kaplan-Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ is a heuristic upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor. Experimentally, it has been shown to closely estimate $D_1$, except in rare edge cases (see discussion in \\citep{Groger2013}). It is defined as\n\\[\nD_{KY}=j + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^j \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{j+1}|},\n\\]\n\\noindent where $j$ is the largest index such that the cumulative sum of the largest $j$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative.\n\n\\section{Mathematical Results}\n\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\n\nAs explained in the Background section, \\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the action of the group $G=SE(2)\\times\\mathbb{R}$. This corresponding Lie algebra is:\n\\[\n\\mathfrak g=\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb R}\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y, x\\partial_y-y\\partial_x, \\partial_t\\}\n\\]\n\nUsing these symmetries, we can derive conditions under which specific forms of solutions exist. We refer to these as \\textit{symmetry solutions}, and we can express them with the ansatz $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0$, where $\\gamma \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ and $A_0=A(\\mathbf{x},0)$. This ansatz becomes a solution when the following equation is satisfied:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\partial_t\\left[e^{t \\gamma} A_0\\right] &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, K * (e^{t \\gamma} A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma\\,e^{t \\gamma} A_0                &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, e^{t \\gamma}(K*A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\gamma A_0                &= e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma A_0                              &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\label{stationary_cond}\n\\end{align}\n\nFrom the second to third line, we use the $G$-equivariance property of $\\mathbf{F}$. We also use the fact that $e^{t\\gamma}$ commutes with $\\gamma$ and $K$ and has an inverse operator $e^{-t\\gamma}$. These facts are not trivial and are a direct consequence of the specific form of the PDE. \n\nA key result of \\eqref{stationary_cond} is that no evolution is required to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{v}t,0)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0,\\,\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we need only find an initial field $A_0$ such that \\eqref{stationary_cond} is satisfied with $\\gamma=-\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}\\partial_x\\,\\, \\partial_y\\end{bmatrix}^\\top$. A similar argument applies to rotating solutions and steady state solutions. Note that since $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{0}, K*\\mathbf{0})=\\mathbf{0}$, a trivial solution to \\eqref{stationary_cond} always exists. \n\nThere is also an important connection between the Lie algebra and the Lyapunov exponents of the system. Theorem 2.15 of \\citet{Aston1994} showed that for $G$-equivariant flows, the number of Lyapunov exponents equal to zero is $\\dim\\{G\\} - \\dim\\{g \\in G\\,|\\,g\\!\\cdot\\!A=A\\}$. In our case, the number of zero exponents equals 4 minus the number of independent continuous symmetries that leave the solution unchanged. For example, a purely translating solution will have at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents because one dimension of the symmetry group (corresponding to translation in the direction of motion combined with an appropriate time shift) acts trivially on the solution.\n\n\\subsection{Dissipativity and Existence of a Global Attractor}\n\nIn this section, we prove a fundamental property of Asymptotic Lenia: all trajectories remain bounded within a finite region of phase space and eventually converge to a common attractor. This property, known as dissipativity, is crucial for understanding the long-term behavior of the system and ensures that the complexity we observe is constrained within a well-defined mathematical structure.\n\nUsing the formal definition from \\cite{Robinson2001}, we can show that discretized Asymptotic Lenia is a dissipative semiflow.  For some $\\varepsilon > 0$, consider the compact set $\\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon=[0-\\varepsilon,1+\\varepsilon]^{N^2} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$, $M(t)=\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. If we choose the initial condition $A[i,j](0)\\in \\mathcal{X}$ and assume $0\\le T(\\cdot)\\le 1$, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{dM}{dt} &= T((K*A)[i_M,j_M]) - M \\le 1 - M \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies M(t) \\le 1 + \\bigl(M(0)-1\\bigr)e^{-t} \\\\[8pt]\n    \\frac{dm}{dt} &= T((K*A)[i_m,j_m]) - m \\ge -m \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies m(t) \\ge m(0)\\,e^{-t}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\noindent where $(i_M,j_M)$ and $(i_m,j_m)$ are the indices of the maximum and minimum values of $A[i,j](t)$ respectively. Therefore, after a finite time\n\n\\[\nt^*= \\max\\left\\{\\ln\\left|\\frac{M(0)-1}{\\varepsilon}\\right|, \\ln\\left|\\frac{m(0)}{\\varepsilon}\\right|\\right\\},\n\\]\nwe must have $A[i,j](t)\\in \\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon,\\, \\forall\\, t \\ge t^*$. We can conclude that there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$. A very similar argument can be used to show that the full PDE is also dissipative, but this is not necessary for our purposes. We can now inquire about the kinds of behavior we expect to see on the attractor. \n\n\\subsection{Helmholtz Decomposition and Behavior on the Attractor}\n\nIn this section, we analyze the mathematical structure of the Asymptotic Lenia dynamics to understand why it can produce complex behaviors such as chaos and periodic oscillations. We show that the system can be decomposed into two fundamental components: a divergence-free (rotational) part and a gradient part. This decomposition, known as the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, reveals why Asymptotic Lenia can exhibit rich dynamics rather than simply settling into static patterns. We start by calculating the Jacobian of $\\mathbf{F}$ from \\eqref{discrete_asymptotic_lenia} as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)}{\\partial A[k,l]} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[k,l]} \\left[T((K*A)[i,j]) - A[i,j]\\right]\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, \\frac{\\partial (K*A)[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]} -  \\frac{\\partial A[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]}\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, K[i-k,j-l] - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}\n\\end{align*}\n\nImposing $K[0,0]$, the divergence of the first term becomes zero so the divergence comes entirely from summing the Kronecker delta terms, giving $\\nabla_A \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = -N^2$. This means that we can write $\\mathbf{F}$ as the sum of a divergence-free term and a term which is the gradient of a scalar potential:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = \\underbrace{T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right)}_{\\text{divergence-free}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[i,j]} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,l} A^2[k,l]\\right]}_{\\text{gradient}}\n\\]\n\nSuch a decomposition is known as a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition \\citep{hhd2013}. We do not comment on the uniqueness of the decomposition due to the possibility for harmonic components, but we can infer that $\\mathbf{F}$ cannot be the gradient of a scalar function. This is because for any arbitrary pair of indices $(i,j)\\ne (k,l)$, the entries of the Jacobian are not necessarily equal due to nonlinearity of $T$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/lyap.png}\n    \\caption{Lyapunov spectra of the four classes of solutions shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. On the left, we plot the values of the top 10 Lyapunov exponents for each solution class. On the right, we plot the values of of the exponents over time to show convergence. The Kaplan-Yorke dimension is calculated based on the values of these exponents and shown in the titles.}\n    \\label{fig:lyap_spectrum}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe stress that this result is crucial for the existence of chaotic or periodic dynamics on attractors. While trajectories of a pure gradient flow are not guaranteed to reach a steady state, they are guaranteed to enter and remain in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the set of steady states \\citep{Hale1988,Robinson2001}. The classic neighbor-sum + non-linearity rule turns out to be exactly the right kind of term to allow for complex behavior.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/clv.png}\n    \\caption{Covariant Lyapunov vectors of the chaotic soliton.

The top 10 CLVs are visualized on the right, where blue and red correspond to negative and positive values respectively.}\n    \\label{fig:clv}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Experimental Results}\n\nHaving established the theoretical framework for analyzing Asymptotic Lenia, we now empirically measure key quantities to characterize the complexity of different solution classes. Our theoretical analysis predicted that chaotic solutions should exhibit a global attractor with fractal dimension between 4 and $N^2$, with the exact dimension reflecting the system's complexity. Here, we verify these predictions by calculating LEs and the corresponding Kaplan-Yorke dimension for representative solutions from each class identified in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.\n\nLEs are calculated for the spatially-discretized flow using the method first proposed by \\citet{Benettin1980}. In particular, we integrate a set of $k$ orthogonal vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ along the linearized flow $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_i=\\nabla_A \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{v}_i$ and repeatedly apply QR decomposition to ensure orthogonality. \\citet{Benettin1980} showed that the top $k$ exponents equal the time average of the logarithmic growth of the tangent vectors' norms between successive applications of QR decomposition. These top $k$ LEs can then be plugged into the Kaplan-Yorke formula to obtain an upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra for four distinct solution classes are shown in \\cref{fig:lyap_spectrum}. We calculate these with a spatial discretization of $N=256$ and a time step of $\\Delta t=0.1$. After an initial transient period, we run a forward pass for 100000 steps and then a backwards pass for 10000 steps to calculate the LEs and CLVs. Since the tangent vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ are initialized randomly and take time to converge, we only average over the last 50000 steps to obtain the finite-time LEs.\n\nAs predicted, the purely rotating and translating solutions have 3 zero LEs, while the chaotic and periodic solutions have 4 zero LEs. Intuitively, in all but the chaotic case, the top LEs are all zero, making $D_{KY}$ exactly equal to the number of zero LEs. When the top LEs are all close to zero, the $D_{KY}$ formula is sensitive to tiny differences in the values, so in practice we round all $|\\lambda_i|<0.001$ to zero. For the chaotic soliton, we found that it had a Kaplan-Yorke dimension of approximately 8.46, with two signficant positive LEs.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra help explain the remarkable robustness to perturbation we observe in practice. Since all but a few of the $N^2$ LEs are negative (with a mean of -1), the system exponentially decays most modes of a random perturbation. In \\cref{fig:clv}, we visualize the unstable, neutral, and stable modes by calculating the covariant Lypaunov vectors (CLVs) for the chaotic soliton. It is important to note that the CLVs are not necessarily orthogonal, and in this case they certainly are not. We also observe that within the set of neutral CLVs, $\\lambda_4$ and $\\lambda_6$ are approximately identical. This is because they theoretically correspond to the same exponent so the CLVs span a degenerate subspace that has no unique decomposition \\citep{Ginelli2013}.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nIn the previous section, we verified that the number of zero LEs matched the theoretically predicted quantity and that chaotic patterns indeed exhibit at least one positive LE and $D_{KY}>4$. The calculation of the LEs was relatively computationally inexpensive and the results were easy to interpret. Compared to other methods of estimating fractal dimension, this ``Lyapunov analysis'' is uniquely effective for reasons we will discuss next.\n\n\\subsection{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension as a Measure of Complexity}\nBoth the box-counting dimension and correlation dimension are impractical measures of fractal dimension for finely discretized PDEs. Box-counting dimension requires constructing histograms with $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-N^2})$ bins, where $\\varepsilon$ is the bin size. Correlation dimension requires calculating the pairwise distance between all sampled fields $A[i,j](n\\Delta t)$ on a trajectory, which is expensive but tractable for moderate $N$ and trajectory lengths. However, convergence is slow because the method relies on sampling many points from the tail of the power-law distance distribution. Experimentally, we also found that log-log plots of the pairwise distance distribution did not have a uniquely identifiable linear region, making the correlation dimension difficult to interpret unambiguously. On the other hand, the Kaplan-Yorke dimension requires just a constant number of Jacobian-vector product operations and QR decompositions to be carried out at each timestep of the state evolution. Even for chaotic attractors, we found in our experiments that convergence to within $1\\%$ of the long-time estimate of $D_{KY}$ required only $\\sim 10^4$ timesteps at $\\Delta t=0.1$. \n\nAdditionally, information dimension (upper bounded by $D_{KY}$) offers the most intuitive interpretation of fractal dimension. It tells us how many bits of information are needed to describe any state on the attractor for a given resolution. Equivalently, we can think of information dimension as answering \\textit{how many real numbers are needed to encode the state} as opposed to how many binary numbers---i.e. entropy. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is the most practical and informative measure of complexity for Continuous Cellular Automata. \n\nWe suggest that future works on Continuous and Neural CAs use $D_{KY}$ to quantify the complexity of patterns they discover. Next, we discuss how we can systematically search for higher complexity in CCAs.\n\n\\subsection{Generalizing CCAs}\nWe begin by summarizing the mathematical predictions, and the minimal assumptions from which we derived them. This is shown in \\cref{tab:assumptions} below.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\\linewidth}p{0.5\\linewidth}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Assumption} & \\textbf{Resulting Prediction} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\partial_t A =T(K*A)-A$,\\newline $K$ radially symmetric. & Possibility of symmetry solutions and up to four $\\lambda_i=0$. \\\\\n\\midrule\n$0 \\le T(\\cdot) \\le 1$,\\newline $T$ Lipschitz continuous & Existence of global attractor. \\\\ \n\\midrule\n$K[0,0] = 0$ & $\\dim \\mathcal{A} < N^2$. Not a gradient flow, possibility of dynamic attractors. \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Summary of key assumptions and their mathematical implications for Asymptotic Lenia dynamics.}\n\\label{tab:assumptions}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe listed assumptions alone do not guarantee the existence of a chaotic attractor. However, we know that at least one choice of $T$ and $K$ satisfying the assumptions does produce a chaotic attractor because Asymptotic Lenia is a known example. We also know that Asymptotic Lenia does span the entire set of such CCAs. The parameterization of $T$ and $K$ via the parameter set $\\{\\mu, \\sigma\\}\\cup \\{\\beta_i\\}$ is just one low-dimensional parameterization of the space of functions satisfying the listed assumptions. \n\nWe could stop there, and suggest that there are many other forms of $T$ and $K$ which exhibit similar kinds of chaotic behavior. However, we aim to find a broader class of CCAs which might exhibit new types of complex behavior like replication, reproduction, or goal-directedness. We suggest that the following general formulation of CCAs be explored in future work:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = f(K*A) - \\nabla_A G(A),\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $K$ is bounded, radially symmetric, and zero at the origin, and $f$ is a Lipschitz continuous nonlinear function such that $0 \\le f(\\cdot) \\le 1$. If we require $G$ be a convex function with no minimizers outside $[0,1]^{N^2}$ and $\\nabla_A G(\\mathbf{1}) \\ge \\mathbf{1}$, we can guarantee both dissipativity and nonpositive divergence. This follows from a similar argument to the one made in the mathematical results section, but we omit the proof. In this formulation, the divergence is still negative since it is the Laplacian of a convex function, but it will also be nonuniform over the phase space. We suspect that nonuniform divergence may be enough for highly multifractal attractors to emerge, leading to novel forms of complexity.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have shown that the mathematical framework of dynamical systems theory can be rigorously applied to Asymptotic Lenia, and that it provides a powerful set of tools for understanding complexity in a broader class of CCAs. We introduced Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension as fundamental concepts and provided a simple open-source implementation of the algorithm used to calculate them. This allowed us to experimentally verify that just a few key properties of the system are sufficient to enable chaotic behavior. Using these properties, we proposed a generalization of CCAs which we believe may contain new forms of complexity which cannot be characterized by a single Lyapunov spectrum.\n\nFor future work, we suggest that the full infinite-dimensional dynamical systems framework be applied to our general CCA formulation. In particular, we are very interested in an extended theoretical framework which could explain and predict phenomena like replication, reproduction, and goal-directedness. We also strongly encourage future works in continuous-time artificial life simulations like neural cellular automata to quantify the complexity of their systems using the Lyapunov analysis presented here.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}Support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number RGPIN-2019-04669 is gratefully acknowledged.\nCette recherche a \\'et\\'e financ\\'ee par le Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en g\\'enie du Canada (CRSNG), num\\'ero de r\\'ef\\'erence RGPIN-2019-04669.

Despite innovations in qualitative behaviour, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. We demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical-systems theory. Employing concepts such as symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions, we mathematically characterise Asymptotic Lenia\u2019s rich behaviours. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic patterns, and chaotic patterns); (2) conditions guaranteeing the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $>4$; (3) identification of the Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs; and (4) an efficient open-source implementation for computing Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors in CCAs. We conclude by isolating the minimal set of properties that enable complex behaviour in a broader family of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial-life systems.\\n\\\\end{abstract}\\n\\nSubmission type: \\\\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\\\\\\n\\nData/code available at: \\\\url{http://will.add.later}\\n\\n\\\\section{Background}\\\\label{sec:background}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Continuous Cellular Automata}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[ht]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\\n    \\\\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, each existing in a distinct region of the PDE\u2019s parameter space.

The \\\\emph{periodic soliton} both translates and oscillates periodically.

In the pursuit of complexity, CAs gradually evolved into a fully non-local PDE formulation. \\\\emph{Larger-than-Life} \\\\citep{Evans2001} enlarged the kernel, \\\\emph{SmoothLife} \\\\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, \\\\emph{Lenia} \\\\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally \\\\emph{Asymptotic Lenia} \\\\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this transition from lookup tables to PDEs, analytical tools for these systems remain under-developed, perpetuating the intuition that emergent complexity resists simple causal explanation.\\n\\nHere we show that adopting a PDE model permits the import of well-established concepts from dynamical-systems theory. After introducing the requisite ideas\u2014symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions\u2014we provide a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure these quantities, obtaining a comprehensive characterisation of the system\u2019s solutions. Finally, we propose a practical complexity metric for CCAs and summarise a concise set of key properties sufficient for complex behaviour across a broader class of CCAs.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\\n\\nOur analysis focuses on Asymptotic Lenia, currently the only CCA formulated explicitly as a continuous PDE \\\\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions are illustrated in \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\\\citet{alenia2021} as\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\partial_t A(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\mathbf{F}(A, K*A) = T(K*A) - A,\\\\label{asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $A \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\\\!\\\\times\\\\!\\\\mathbb{R}^{+} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued scalar field, $K \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ denotes 2-D convolution, and $T \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\\\exp\\\\bigl[-\\\\tfrac12(u-\\\\mu)^{2}/\\\\sigma^{2}\\\\bigr]$ is parameterised by $0<\\\\sigma\\\\ll\\\\mu$ and is typically approximated by a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\\\mathbf{x})=K(\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|_2)$ is a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r) = \\\\bigl(4r(r-1)\\\\bigr)^{4}$, with parameters $\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\}$ controlling the ring amplitudes and $R$ setting the overall spatial scale. Crucially, $K(0)=0$, and $K$ is normalised so that $\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} K(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with periodic boundary conditions.\\n\\nWe also consider the spatially discretised version of Asymptotic Lenia, yielding a finite-dimensional ODE system that mirrors practical numerical implementations. At each grid point $(i,j)\\\\in[0,N-1]^{2}$ we define the time-dependent variable $A[i,j](t)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. The dynamics are\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}A[i,j](t)=\\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)=T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr)-A[i,j].\\\\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\\n\\nTo analyse Asymptotic Lenia we employ the framework of dynamical systems for fields\u2014functions of space\u2014evolving through time. Although a fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment lies beyond the scope of this paper, we restrict attention to the finite-dimensional setting without sacrificing generality. One key concept borrowed from the infinite-dimensional theory is \\\\emph{symmetry}.\\n\\nA \\\\emph{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions to solutions \\\\citep{Olver1986}. When the transformation depends on a continuous parameter (e.g. translation by $\\\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is \\\\emph{continuous}. Continuous symmetries form a \\\\emph{Lie group}. For example, the plane\u2019s rotations and translations constitute the Lie group $SE(2)$. The corresponding infinitesimal transformations form the \\\\emph{Lie algebra}, whose elements are the \\\\emph{generators} of the group\u2014for instance, $\\\\partial_x$ and $\\\\partial_y$ generate planar translations, while $x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x$ generates rotations. All two-dimensional CCAs are invariant under $SE(2)$ because their update rules are spatially homogeneous and depend only on radial distance; they are also invariant under time translation because the rule is autonomous.\\n\\nWe now recast the finite-dimensional theory in the language of \\\\citet[e.g.][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}, mapping each definition onto discretised Asymptotic Lenia:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Phase space} $\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}}$: the set of all possible states.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Evolution law} $\\\\dot A(t)=\\\\mathbf{F}(A)$: the ODE system governing temporal evolution.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Semiflow} $\\\\Phi_t\\\\bigl(A(0)\\\\bigr)=A(t)$, $t\\\\ge0$: maps an initial state to its future state. Existence follows because $\\\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz and $|A|$ cannot blow up in finite time \\\\citep{Robinson2001}\\\\footnote{The Lipschitz property follows from the boundedness of $K*A$ and Lipschitz continuity of $T$. The norm $|A|$ is bounded because it can grow or decay at most exponentially.}.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nThe following properties then apply.\\n\\\\paragraph{Dissipativity.} A semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ on $\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is \\\\emph{dissipative} if there exists a bounded set $\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that absorbs every trajectory in finite time.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Global attractor.} If $\\\\Phi_t$ is dissipative, there exists a \\\\emph{global attractor} $\\\\mathcal{A}$\u2014the minimal set toward which all trajectories converge as $t\\\\to\\\\infty$. The attractor encapsulates all long-term dynamics and supports at least one invariant measure.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Fractal dimension.} Dissipative chaotic systems settle onto attractors of zero phase-space volume that cannot be represented by integer-dimensional manifolds. Such \\\\emph{fractal attractors} are characterised by their fractal dimension. We focus on the generalised dimensions \\\\citep{Grassberger1983}\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n    D_q = \\\\frac{1}{1-q}\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to0}\\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\bigl(\\\\sum_i p_i^{q}\\\\bigr)}{\\\\log (1/\\\\varepsilon)},\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\nwhere $p_i$ is the mass in the $i$-th box of a uniform phase-space partition of size $\\\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\\\emph{box-counting} dimension, $D_1$ the \\\\emph{information} dimension, and $D_2$ the \\\\emph{correlation} dimension; they coincide only when the invariant density is uniform.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Lyapunov exponents.} The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. A positive exponent signals chaos because nearby trajectories diverge exponentially. Among several equivalent definitions (see \\\\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020}), the most convenient here is\\n\\\\[\\n    \\\\lambda_i\\\\bigl(A(0)\\\\bigr)=\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\log \\\\sigma_i\\\\bigl(A(0),t\\\\bigr),\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\\\nabla_A\\\\Phi_t$. These exponents can be approximated numerically via the algorithm of \\\\citet{Benettin1980}. Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), giving the associated perturbation directions, follow from a short backward pass \\\\citep{Ginelli2007}.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension.} The Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ provides a heuristic upper bound on $D_1$ and often matches it closely \\\\citep{Groger2013}:\\n\\\\[\\n    D_{KY}=j+\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{j}\\\\lambda_i}{|\\\\lambda_{j+1}|},\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $j$ is the largest index for which the cumulative sum of the $j$ largest exponents is non-negative.\\n\\n\\\\section{Mathematical Results}\\n\\\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\\n\\nEquation~\\\\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the group $G=SE(2)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding Lie algebra is\\n\\\\[\\n    \\\\mathfrak g=\\\\operatorname{span}_{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\{\\\\partial_x,\\\\;\\\\partial_y,\\\\;x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x,\\\\;\\\\partial_t\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\nUsing these symmetries we derive \\\\emph{symmetry solutions}. Employing the ansatz $A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0$ with $\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g$ and $A_0=A(\\\\mathbf{x},0)$, we obtain\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n    \\\\partial_t\\\\bigl[e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0\\\\bigr] &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0, K*(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0)\\\\bigr)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0 &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0, e^{t\\\\gamma}(K*A_0)\\\\bigr)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    e^{t\\\\gamma}\\\\gamma A_0 &= e^{t\\\\gamma}\\\\mathbf{F}(A_0,K*A_0)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma A_0 &= \\\\mathbf{F}(A_0,K*A_0).\\\\label{stationary_cond}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nThe third line uses $G$-equivariance of $\\\\mathbf{F}$ and the commutativity of $e^{t\\\\gamma}$ with $\\\\gamma$ and $K$. Condition~\\\\eqref{stationary_cond} means no temporal evolution is needed to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution with velocity $\\\\mathbf{v}$\u2014$A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{v}t,0)$\u2014one seeks $A_0$ satisfying \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} with $\\\\gamma=-\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot[\\\\partial_x\\\\,\\\\partial_y]^\\\\top$. A trivial solution always exists because $\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{0},K*\\\\mathbf{0})=\\\\mathbf{0}$.\\n\\n\\\\citet[Thm.~2.15]{Aston1994} showed that for $G$-equivariant flows the number of zero Lyapunov exponents equals $\\\\dim G-\\\\dim\\\\{g\\\\in G\\\\mid g\\\\cdot A=A\\\\}$. Hence a purely translating solution has at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents, while a solution fixed by all symmetries has four.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dissipativity and the Global Attractor}\\n\\nWe now establish that all trajectories remain bounded and converge to a common attractor. Following \\\\citet{Robinson2001}, discretised Asymptotic Lenia forms a dissipative semiflow. For $\\\\varepsilon>0$ define $\\\\mathcal{B}_{\\\\varepsilon}=[-\\\\varepsilon,1+\\\\varepsilon]^{N^{2}}\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$ and $M(t)=\\\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. Assuming $0\\\\le T(\\\\cdot)\\\\le1$ and starting from any $A[i,j](0)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}$,\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n    \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}M}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} &= T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i_M,j_M]\\\\bigr)-M \\\\le 1-M,\\\\\\\\[4pt]\\n    &\\\\Rightarrow M(t)\\\\le1+\\\\bigl(M(0)-1\\\\bigr)e^{-t},\\\\\\\\[8pt]\\n    \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}m}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} &= T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i_m,j_m]\\\\bigr)-m \\\\ge -m,\\\\\\\\[4pt]\\n    &\\\\Rightarrow m(t)\\\\ge m(0)e^{-t},\\n\\\\end{align*}\\nwhere $(i_M,j_M)$ and $(i_m,j_m)$ index the maximum and minimum values. After\\n\\\\[\\n    t^{*}=\\\\max\\\\Bigl\\\\{\\\\ln\\\\Bigl|\\\\tfrac{M(0)-1}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\Bigr|,\\\\;\\\\ln\\\\Bigl|\\\\tfrac{m(0)}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\Bigr|\\\\Bigr\\\\},\\n\\\\]\\nall trajectories lie in $\\\\mathcal{B}_{\\\\varepsilon}$ for $t\\\\ge t^{*}$. Hence a global attractor $\\\\mathcal{A}$ exists. A parallel argument applies to the continuous PDE, but is omitted.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Helmholtz Decomposition and Dynamics on the Attractor}\\n\\nTo understand why Asymptotic Lenia supports complex behaviour, we decompose its vector field into divergence-free and gradient parts via the Helmholtz\u2013Hodge theorem \\\\citep{hhd2013}. Computing the Jacobian of \\\\eqref{discrete_asymptotic_lenia} yields\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n    \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)}{\\\\partial A[k,l]} &= T'\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr)\\\\,K[i-k,j-l]-\\\\delta_{ik}\\\\delta_{jl}.\\n\\\\end{align*}\\nSetting $K[0,0]=0$ makes the first term divergence-free; summing the Kronecker deltas gives $\\\\nabla_A\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F}=-N^{2}$. Thus\\n\\\\[\\n    \\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)=\\\\underbrace{T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr)}_{\\\\text{divergence-free}}+\\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial A[i,j]}\\\\Bigl[-\\\\tfrac12\\\\sum_{k,l}A^{2}[k,l]\\\\Bigr]}_{\\\\text{gradient}}.\\n\\\\]\\nBecause $\\\\mathbf{F}$ is not a pure gradient field, trajectories need not approach fixed points and can settle onto dynamic attractors. This decomposition clarifies why classic \u201cneighbour-sum plus non-linearity\u201d rules support periodic and chaotic motions.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure*}[ht]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\linewidth]{figs/lyap.png}\\n    \\\\caption{Lyapunov spectra for the four solution classes of \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.

Theory predicts that chaotic solutions possess a global attractor whose fractal dimension lies between 4 and $N^{2}$, reflecting systemic complexity. We verify this by computing LEs and the Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension for representative solutions from \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.\\n\\nLEs are obtained for the discretised flow using the algorithm of \\\\citet{Benettin1980}. We integrate $k$ orthogonal tangent vectors $\\\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ via $\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{v}}_{i}=\\\\nabla_A\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ and periodically apply QR decomposition to maintain orthogonality. The time-averaged logarithmic growth of $\\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\\\|$ yields the $k$ largest exponents, which feed into the Kaplan\u2013Yorke formula.\\n\\nSpectra for the four solution classes appear in \\\\cref{fig:lyap_spectrum}. Simulations use $N=256$ and $\\\\Delta t=0.1$. After discarding transients, we perform a 100,000-step forward pass and a 10,000-step backward pass, averaging the last 50,000 steps to estimate finite-time LEs.\\n\\nAs expected, purely rotating and translating solutions have three zero exponents, whereas periodic and chaotic solutions have four. For non-chaotic classes the largest exponents are effectively zero, so $D_{KY}$ equals the number of zero exponents (we set $|\\\\lambda_i|<10^{-3}$ to zero). The chaotic soliton exhibits two significant positive exponents and $D_{KY}\\\\approx8.46$.\\n\\nThe spectra explain the system\u2019s robustness to perturbations: all but a handful of the $N^{2}$ exponents are negative (mean $-1$), so most perturbation modes decay exponentially. \\\\cref{fig:clv} visualises unstable, neutral, and stable directions via the CLVs of the chaotic soliton. Within the neutral set, $\\\\lambda_{4}$ and $\\\\lambda_{6}$ share nearly identical CLVs, reflecting a degenerate subspace \\\\citep{Ginelli2013}.\\n\\n\\\\section{Discussion}\\n\\nThe computations confirm theory: zero exponents match symmetry predictions, and chaotic patterns possess at least one positive exponent with $D_{KY}>4$. Lyapunov analysis is computationally inexpensive and interpretable compared with traditional fractal-dimension estimators.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Kaplan\u2013Yorke Dimension as a Complexity Measure}\\nBox-counting dimension is impractical for finely discretised PDEs, and correlation dimension converges slowly because it relies on sampling the heavy tail of pairwise distances. By contrast, Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension requires only Jacobian\u2013vector products and QR decompositions at each time step. Even for chaotic attractors, we achieve $<1\\\\%$ error after roughly $10^{4}$ steps at $\\\\Delta t=0.1$.\\n\\nBecause $D_{KY}$ upper-bounds the information dimension, it answers the intuitive question: \\\\emph{how many real numbers are needed to specify a state on the attractor at a given resolution?} We therefore recommend $D_{KY}$ as a practical complexity metric for continuous and neural cellular automata.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Generalising CCAs}\\n\\\\cref{tab:assumptions} summarises the mathematical predictions and the minimal assumptions underlying them.\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}[h]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\begin{tabular}{p{0.42\\\\linewidth}p{0.48\\\\linewidth}}\\n        \\\\toprule\\n        \\\\textbf{Assumption} & \\\\textbf{Prediction}\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\midrule\\n        $\\\\partial_tA=T(K*A)-A$,\\\\quad $K$ radially symmetric & Symmetry solutions and up to four zero Lyapunov exponents.\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\midrule\\n        $0\\\\le T(\\\\cdot)\\\\le1$, $T$ Lipschitz & Existence of a global attractor.\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\midrule\\n        $K[0,0]=0$ & $\\\\dim\\\\mathcal{A}<N^{2}$; flow is not a pure gradient, allowing dynamic attractors.\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\bottomrule\\n    \\\\end{tabular}\\n    \\\\caption{Key assumptions and their implications for Asymptotic Lenia dynamics.}\\n    \\\\label{tab:assumptions}\\n\\\\end{table}\\n\\nThese assumptions do not guarantee chaos, but Asymptotic Lenia shows that suitable $T$ and $K$ satisfying them can produce chaotic attractors. Nevertheless, Asymptotic Lenia explores only a low-dimensional subset of all such functions.\\n\\nTo seek richer phenomena\u2014including replication and goal-directedness\u2014we propose studying the broader class\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\partial_tA(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=f(K*A)-\\\\nabla_A G(A),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $K$ is bounded, radially symmetric, and satisfies $K(0)=0$; $f$ is Lipschitz with $0\\\\le f\\\\le1$; and $G$ is convex with no minimisers outside $[0,1]^{N^{2}}$ and $\\\\nabla_A G(\\\\mathbf{1})\\\\ge\\\\mathbf{1}$. These conditions ensure dissipativity and non-positive, spatially varying divergence, which may yield highly multifractal attractors and new forms of complexity.\\n\\n\\\\section{Conclusion}\\n\\nWe have shown that dynamical-systems theory provides rigorous tools for analysing Asymptotic Lenia and, by extension, a broad family of CCAs. By computing Lyapunov spectra and fractal dimensions with an open-source implementation, we experimentally verified that a small set of properties suffices for chaotic behaviour. Extending this framework could illuminate replication, reproduction, and goal-directedness in artificial-life models. We encourage future work on continuous-time neural cellular automata to quantify complexity using the Lyapunov analysis outlined here.\\n\\n\\\\section*{Acknowledgments}\\nSupport from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number RGPIN-2019-04669, is gratefully acknowledged.

In the pursuit of complexity, CAs gradually evolved into a fully non\u2011local PDE formulation. \\\\emph{Larger\u2011than\u2011Life} \\\\citep{Evans2001} enlarged the kernel, \\\\emph{SmoothLife} \\\\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, \\\\emph{Lenia} \\\\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally \\\\emph{Asymptotic Lenia} \\\\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this transition from lookup tables to PDEs, analytical tools for these systems remain under\u2011developed, perpetuating the intuition that emergent complexity resists simple causal explanation.\\n\\nHere we show that adopting a PDE model permits the import of well\u2011established concepts from dynamical\u2011systems theory. After introducing the requisite ideas\u2014symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions\u2014we provide a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure these quantities, obtaining a comprehensive characterisation of the system\u2019s solutions. Finally, we propose a practical complexity metric for CCAs and summarise a concise set of key properties sufficient for complex behaviour across a broader class of CCAs.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\\n\\nOur analysis focuses on Asymptotic Lenia, currently the only CCA formulated explicitly as a continuous PDE \\\\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions are illustrated in \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\\\citet{alenia2021} as\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\partial_t A(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\mathbf{F}(A, K*A) = T(K*A) - A,\\\\label{asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $A \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\\\!\\\\times\\\\!\\\\mathbb{R}^{+} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a real\u2011valued scalar field, $K \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ denotes 2\u2011D convolution, and $T \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\\\exp\\\\bigl[-\\\\tfrac12(u-\\\\mu)^{2}/\\\\sigma^{2}\\\\bigr]$ is parameterised by $0<\\\\sigma\\\\ll\\\\mu$ and is typically approximated by a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\\\mathbf{x})=K(\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|_2)$ is a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r) = \\\\bigl(4r(r-1)\\\\bigr)^{4}$, with parameters $\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\}$ controlling the ring amplitudes and $R$ setting the overall spatial scale. Crucially, $K(0)=0$, and $K$ is normalised so that $\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} K(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with periodic boundary conditions.\\n\\nWe also consider the spatially discretised version of Asymptotic Lenia, yielding a finite\u2011dimensional ODE system that mirrors practical numerical implementations. At each grid point $(i,j)\\\\in[0,N-1]^{2}$ we define the time\u2011dependent variable $A[i,j](t)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. The dynamics are\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}A[i,j](t)=\\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)=T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr)-A[i,j].\\\\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\\n\\nTo analyse Asymptotic Lenia we employ the framework of dynamical systems for fields\u2014functions of space\u2014evolving through time. Although a fully rigorous infinite\u2011dimensional treatment lies beyond the scope of this paper, we restrict attention to the finite\u2011dimensional setting without sacrificing generality. One key concept borrowed from the infinite\u2011dimensional theory is \\\\emph{symmetry}.\\n\\nA \\\\emph{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions to solutions \\\\citep{Olver1986}. When the transformation depends on a continuous parameter (e.g. translation by $\\\\delta$ in the $x$\u2011direction), the symmetry is \\\\emph{continuous}. Continuous symmetries form a \\\\emph{Lie group}. For example, the plane\u2019s rotations and translations constitute the Lie group $SE(2)$. The corresponding infinitesimal transformations form the \\\\emph{Lie algebra}, whose elements are the \\\\emph{generators} of the group\u2014for instance, $\\\\partial_x$ and $\\\\partial_y$ generate planar translations, while $x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x$ generates rotations. All two\u2011dimensional CCAs are invariant under $SE(2)$ because their update rules are spatially homogeneous and depend only on radial distance; they are also invariant under time translation because the rule is autonomous.\\n\\nWe now recast the finite\u2011dimensional theory in the language of \\\\citet[e.g.][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}, mapping each definition onto discretised Asymptotic Lenia:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Phase space} $\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}}$: the set of all possible states.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Evolution law} $\\\\dot A(t)=\\\\mathbf{F}(A)$: the ODE system governing temporal evolution.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Semiflow} $\\\\Phi_t\\\\bigl(A(0)\\\\bigr)=A(t)$, $t\\\\ge0$: maps an initial state to its future state. Existence follows because $\\\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz and $|A|$ cannot blow up in finite time \\\\citep{Robinson2001}\\\\footnote{The Lipschitz property follows from the boundedness of $K*A$ and Lipschitz continuity of $T$. The norm $|A|$ is bounded because it can grow or decay at most exponentially.}.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nThe following properties then apply.\\n\\\\paragraph{Dissipativity.} A semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ on $\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is \\\\emph{dissipative} if there exists a bounded set $\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that absorbs every trajectory in finite time.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Global attractor.} If $\\\\Phi_t$ is dissipative, there exists a \\\\emph{global attractor} $\\\\mathcal{A}$\u2014the minimal set toward which all trajectories converge as $t\\\\to\\\\infty$. The attractor encapsulates all long\u2011term dynamics and supports at least one invariant measure.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Fractal dimension.} Dissipative chaotic systems settle onto attractors of zero phase\u2011space volume that cannot be represented by integer\u2011dimensional manifolds. Such \\\\emph{fractal attractors} are characterised by their fractal dimension. We focus on the generalised dimensions \\\\citep{Grassberger1983}\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n    D_q = \\\\frac{1}{1-q}\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to0}\\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\bigl(\\\\sum_i p_i^{q}\\\\bigr)}{\\\\log (1/\\\\varepsilon)},\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\nwhere $p_i$ is the mass in the $i$\u2011th box of a uniform phase\u2011space partition of size $\\\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\\\emph{box\u2011counting} dimension, $D_1$ the \\\\emph{information} dimension, and $D_2$ the \\\\emph{correlation} dimension; they coincide only when the invariant density is uniform.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Lyapunov exponents.} The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. A positive exponent signals chaos because nearby trajectories diverge exponentially. Among several equivalent definitions (see \\\\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020}), the most convenient here is\\n\\\\[\\n    \\\\lambda_i\\\\bigl(A(0)\\\\bigr)=\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\log \\\\sigma_i\\\\bigl(A(0),t\\\\bigr),\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\sigma_i$ is the $i$\u2011th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\\\nabla_A\\\\Phi_t$. These exponents can be approximated numerically via the algorithm of \\\\citet{Benettin1980}. Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), giving the associated perturbation directions, follow from a short backward pass \\\\citep{Ginelli2007}.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension.} The Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ provides a heuristic upper bound on $D_1$ and often matches it closely \\\\citep{Groger2013}:\\n\\\\[\\n    D_{KY}=j+\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{j}\\\\lambda_i}{|\\\\lambda_{j+1}|},\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $j$ is the largest index for which the cumulative sum of the $j$ largest exponents is non\u2011negative.\\n\\n\\\\section{Mathematical Results}\\n\\\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\\n\\nEquation~\\\\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the group $G=SE(2)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding Lie algebra is\\n\\\\[\\n    \\\\mathfrak g=\\\\operatorname{span}_{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\{\\\\partial_x,\\\\;\\\\partial_y,\\\\;x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x,\\\\;\\\\partial_t\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\nUsing these symmetries we derive \\\\emph{symmetry solutions}. Employing the ansatz $A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0$ with $\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g$ and $A_0=A(\\\\mathbf{x},0)$, we obtain\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n    \\\\partial_t\\\\bigl[e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0\\\\bigr] &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0, K*(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0)\\\\bigr)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0 &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0, e^{t\\\\gamma}(K*A_0)\\\\bigr)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    e^{t\\\\gamma}\\\\gamma A_0 &= e^{t\\\\gamma}\\\\mathbf{F}(A_0,K*A_0)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma A_0 &= \\\\mathbf{F}(A_0,K*A_0).\\\\label{stationary_cond}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nThe third line uses $G$\u2011equivariance of $\\\\mathbf{F}$ and the commutativity of $e^{t\\\\gamma}$ with $\\\\gamma$ and $K$. Condition~\\\\eqref{stationary_cond} means no temporal evolution is needed to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution with velocity $\\\\mathbf{v}$\u2014$A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{v}t,0)$\u2014one seeks $A_0$ satisfying \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} with $\\\\gamma=-\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot[\\\\partial_x\\\\,\\\\partial_y]^\\\\top$. A trivial solution always exists because $\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{0},K*\\\\mathbf{0})=\\\\mathbf{0}$.\\n\\n\\\\citet[Thm.~2.15]{Aston1994} showed that for $G$\u2011equivariant flows the number of zero Lyapunov exponents equals $\\\\dim G-\\\\dim\\\\{g\\\\in G\\\\mid g\\\\cdot A=A\\\\}$. Hence a purely translating solution has at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents, while a solution fixed by all symmetries has four.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dissipativity and the Global Attractor}\\n\\nWe now establish that all trajectories remain bounded and converge to a common attractor. Following \\\\citet{Robinson2001}, discretised Asymptotic Lenia forms a dissipative semiflow. For $\\\\varepsilon>0$ define $\\\\mathcal{B}_{\\\\varepsilon}=[-\\\\varepsilon,1+\\\\varepsilon]^{N^{2}}\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$ and $M(t)=\\\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. Assuming $0\\\\le T(\\\\cdot)\\\\le1$ and starting from any $A[i,j](0) is not a quote, tether browsing display, or sonic page."

The PDE is defined by \\\\citet{alenia2021} as\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\partial_t A(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\mathbf{F}(A, K*A) = T(K*A) - A,\\\\label{asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $A \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\\\!\\\\times\\\\!\\\\mathbb{R}^{+} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a real\u2011valued scalar field, $K \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ denotes 2\u2011D convolution, and $T \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\\\exp\\\\bigl[-\\\\tfrac12(u-\\\\mu)^{2}/\\\\sigma^{2}\\\\bigr]$ is parameterised by $0<\\\\sigma\\\\ll\\\\mu$ and is typically approximated by a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\\\mathbf{x})=K(\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|_2)$ is a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r) = \\\\bigl(4r(r-1)\\\\bigr)^{4}$, with parameters $\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\}$ controlling the ring amplitudes and $R$ setting the overall spatial scale. Crucially, $K(0)=0$, and $K$ is normalised so that $\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} K(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with periodic boundary conditions.\\n\\nWe also consider the spatially discretised version of Asymptotic Lenia, yielding a finite\u2011dimensional ODE system that mirrors practical numerical implementations. At each grid point $(i,j)\\\\in[0,N-1]^{2}$ we define the time\u2011dependent variable $A[i,j](t)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. The dynamics are\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}A[i,j](t)=\\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)=T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr)-A[i,j].\\\\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\\n\\nTo analyse Asymptotic Lenia we employ the framework of dynamical systems for fields\u2014functions of space\u2014evolving through time. Although a fully rigorous infinite\u2011dimensional treatment lies beyond the scope of this paper, we restrict attention to the finite\u2011dimensional setting without sacrificing generality. One key concept borrowed from the infinite\u2011dimensional theory is \\\\emph{symmetry}.\\n\\nA \\\\emph{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions to solutions \\\\citep{Olver1986}. When the transformation depends on a continuous parameter (e.g. translation by $\\\\delta$ in the $x$\u2011direction), the symmetry is \\\\emph{continuous}. Continuous symmetries form a \\\\emph{Lie group}. For example, the plane\u2019s rotations and translations constitute the Lie group $SE(2)$. The corresponding infinitesimal transformations form the \\\\emph{Lie algebra}, whose elements are the \\\\emph{generators} of the group\u2014for instance, $\\\\partial_x$ and $\\\\partial_y$ generate planar translations, while $x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x$ generates rotations. All two\u2011dimensional CCAs are invariant under $SE(2)$ because their update rules are spatially homogeneous and depend only on radial distance; they are also invariant under time translation because the rule is autonomous.\\n\\nWe now recast the finite\u2011dimensional theory in the language of \\\\citet[e.g.][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}, mapping each definition onto discretised Asymptotic Lenia:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Phase space} $\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}}$: the set of all possible states.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Evolution law} $\\\\dot A(t)=\\\\mathbf{F}(A)$: the ODE system governing temporal evolution.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textbf{Semiflow} $\\\\Phi_t\\\\bigl(A(0)\\\\bigr)=A(t)$, $t\\\\ge0$: maps an initial state to its future state. Existence follows because $\\\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz and $|A|$ cannot blow up in finite time \\\\citep{Robinson2001}\\\\footnote{The Lipschitz property follows from the boundedness of $K*A$ and Lipschitz continuity of $T$. The norm $|A|$ is bounded because it can grow or decay at most exponentially.}.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nThe following properties then apply.\\n\\\\paragraph{Dissipativity.} A semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ on $\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is \\\\emph{dissipative} if there exists a bounded set $\\\\mathcal{B}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that absorbs every trajectory in finite time.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Global attractor.} If $\\\\Phi_t$ is dissipative, there exists a \\\\emph{global attractor} $\\\\mathcal{A}$\u2014the minimal set toward which all trajectories converge as $t\\\\to\\\\infty$. The attractor encapsulates all long\u2011term dynamics and supports at least one invariant measure.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Fractal dimension.} Dissipative chaotic systems settle onto attractors of zero phase\u2011space volume that cannot be represented by integer\u2011dimensional manifolds. Such \\\\emph{fractal attractors} are characterised by their fractal dimension. We focus on the generalised dimensions \\\\citep{Grassberger1983}\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n    D_q = \\\\frac{1}{1-q}\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to0}\\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\bigl(\\\\sum_i p_i^{q}\\\\bigr)}{\\\\log (1/\\\\varepsilon)},\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\nwhere $p_i$ is the mass in the $i$\u2011th box of a uniform phase\u2011space partition of size $\\\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\\\emph{box\u2011counting} dimension, $D_1$ the \\\\emph{information} dimension, and $D_2$ the \\\\emph{correlation} dimension; they coincide only when the invariant density is uniform.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Lyapunov exponents.} The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. A positive exponent signals chaos because nearby trajectories diverge exponentially. Among several equivalent definitions (see \\\\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020}), the most convenient here is\\n\\\\[\\n    \\\\lambda_i\\\\bigl(A(0)\\\\bigr)=\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\log \\\\sigma_i\\\\bigl(A(0),t\\\\bigr),\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $\\\\sigma_i$ is the $i$\u2011th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\\\nabla_A\\\\Phi_t$. These exponents can be approximated numerically via the algorithm of \\\\citet{Benettin1980}. Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), giving the associated perturbation directions, follow from a short backward pass \\\\citep{Ginelli2007}.\\n\\n\\\\paragraph{Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension.} The Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ provides a heuristic upper bound on $D_1$ and often matches it closely \\\\citep{Groger2013}:\\n\\\\[\\n    D_{KY}=j+\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{j}\\\\lambda_i}{|\\\\lambda_{j+1}|},\\n\\\\]\\nwhere $j$ is the largest index for which the cumulative sum of the $j$ largest exponents is non\u2011negative.\\n\\n\\\\section{Mathematical Results}\\n\\\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\\n\\nEquation~\\\\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the group $G=SE(2)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding Lie algebra is\\n\\\\[\\n    \\\\mathfrak g=\\\\operatorname{span}_{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\{\\\\partial_x,\\\\;\\\\partial_y,\\\\;x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x,\\\\;\\\\partial_t\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\nUsing these symmetries we derive \\\\emph{symmetry solutions}. Employing the ansatz $A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0$ with $\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g$ and $A_0=A(\\\\mathbf{x},0)$, we obtain\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n    \\\\partial_t\\\\bigl[e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0\\\\bigr] &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0, K*(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0)\\\\bigr)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0 &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t\\\\gamma}A_0, e^{t\\\\gamma}(K*A_0)\\\\bigr)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    e^{t\\\\gamma}\\\\gamma A_0 &= e^{t\\\\gamma}\\\\mathbf{F}(A_0,K*A_0)\\\\nonumber\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma A_0 &= \\\\mathbf{F}(A_0,K*A_0).\\\\label{stationary_cond}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nThe third line uses $G$\u2011equivariance of $\\\\mathbf{F}$ and the commutativity of $e^{t\\\\gamma}$ with $\\\\gamma$ and $K$. Condition~\\\\eqref{stationary_cond} means no temporal evolution is needed to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution with velocity $\\\\mathbf{v}$\u2014$A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{v}t,0)$\u2014one seeks $A_0$ satisfying \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} with $\\\\gamma=-\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot[\\\\partial_x\\\\,\\\\partial_y]^\\\\top$. A trivial solution always exists because $\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{0},K*\\\\mathbf{0})=\\\\mathbf{0}$.\\n\\n\\\\citet[Thm.~2.15]{Aston1994} showed that for $G$\u2011equivariant flows the number of zero Lyapunov exponents equals $\\\\dim G-\\\\dim\\\\{g\\\\in G\\\\mid g\\\\cdot A=A\\\\}$. Hence a purely translating solution has at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents, while a solution fixed by all symmetries has four.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dissipativity and the Global Attractor}\\n\\nWe now establish that all trajectories remain bounded and converge to a common attractor. Following \\\\citet{Robinson2001}, discretised Asymptotic Lenia forms a dissipative semiflow. For $\\\\varepsilon>0$ define $\\\\mathcal{B}_{\\\\varepsilon}=[-\\\\varepsilon,1+\\\\varepsilon]^{N^{2}}\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$ and $M(t)=\\\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. Assuming $0\\\\le T(\\\\cdot)\\\\le1$ and starting from any $A[i,j](0)",

Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan-Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source  implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n% Choose one of: Full Paper, Summaries, or Late Breaking Abstracts \nSubmission type: \\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\n\n% If sharing code / data, anonymize your repository and paste the link here.\n% Example of anonymizing sevice for github: https://anonymous.4open.science/\n% delete this line if not needed\nData/Code available at: \\url{http://will.add.later}\n\n\\section{Background}\\label{sec:background}\n\n\\subsection{Continuous Cellular Automata}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\n    \\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, which exist in distinct regions of the PDE's parameter space. The \\textit{soliton} is a stable, purely translating solution. The \\textit{rotator} is a stable, purely rotating solution. The \\textit{periodic soliton} is a translating solution which also oscillates periodically. The \\textit{chaotic soliton} exhibits a chaotic combination of translations, rotations, and internal oscillations.}\n    \\label{fig:lenia_zoo}\n\\end{figure}\n\nContinuous cellular automata (CCAs) were initially invented to recreate the complex emergent behavior of the program known as Conway's Game of Life \\citep{Gardner1970}, with the hope of finding more life-like patterns. In the search for complexity, CAs gradually evolved towards a pure (non-local) partial differential equation (PDE) formulation. Larger-than-life \\citep{Evans2001} increased the size of the kernel, SmoothLife \\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, Lenia \\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally Asymptotic Lenia \\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this total transition from lookup table to PDE, the methods for analyzing these systems have seen very little progress. As a result, the field has largely retained the intuition that emergent complexity has no simple causal explanation.\n\nIn this paper, we show that transitioning to a PDE model of CCAs allows us to import well-established mathematical concepts from dynamical systems theory. We first introduce the main concepts: symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimension, and more. Using these concepts, we establish a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure the relevant quantities to obtain a complete characterization of the complexity of solutions. Finally, we suggest a specific quantity for measuring complexity in CCAs and summarize the small set of key properties which are sufficient for a broader class of CCAs to exhibit complex behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\n\nOur analysis centers around the Asymptotic Lenia system since it is the only CCA discovered thus far that is defined as a continuous PDE \\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions to the PDE are shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\citet{alenia2021} as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\mathbf{F}(A,K*A) = T(K*A) - A, \\label{asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $A \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued 2-D scalar field, $K \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ is the 2-D convolution operator, and $T \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function, applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}(u-\\mu)^2/\\sigma^2)$ is parameterized by $0<\\sigma \\ll \\mu$, and is typically approximated via a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\mathbf{x})=K(\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2)$ is composed of a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r)=(4r(r-1))^4$ with parameters $\\{\\beta_i\\}$ controlling the scaling of the rings, and $R$ controlling the overall spatial scale. Importantly, $K(0)=0$ and $K$ is normalized such that $\\int_{\\Omega} K(\\mathbf{x})\\,d\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume that the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe also define the spatially-discretized version of Asymptotic Lenia, which is a finite-dimensional (ODE) approximation of the PDE, and is closer to the true numerical implementation of the system. At each discrete point in space $(i,j) \\in [0,N-1]^2$, we define a function of time $A[i,j](t)\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The field's dynamics are given by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d}{dt} A[i,j](t) = \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right) - A[i,j]. \\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\n\nTo analyze Asymptotic Lenia, we seek a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of fields---functions of space---over time. This is the subject of the theory of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. In this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to the finite-dimensional setting because it makes our results easier to follow, without loss of generality. A fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment of CCAs is beyond the scope of this paper, but we do borrow one important concept: symmetry.\n\nA \\textit{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions \\citep{Olver1986}. If the transformation depends on a single continuous parameter (e.g. a shift by $\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is called a \\textit{continuous symmetry}. Continuous symmetries can be organized into a \\textit{Lie group}. An example of a Lie group is the set of rotations and translations on a 2-D plane $SE(2)$. The associated set of infinitesimal transformations is called the \\textit{Lie algebra} and it is composed of the \\textit{generators} of the group. For example, the generators for translation in the $x$-direction is $\\partial_x$ and the generator for rotation is $x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x$. All 2-D CCAs are invariant under the action of the group $SE(2)$ because the update rule is identical across all of space, and the non-local component is only a function of radial distance. They are also invariant under time translation since the update rule is autonomous, meaning it is independent of time.\n\nNow, we describe the finite-dimensional setting for dynamical systems theory in the language of \\citep[e.g.,][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}. The definitions are mapped to discretized Asymptotic Lenia as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{Phase Space}: $\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$: The set of all possible states of the system. \n    \\item \\textit{Evolution Law}: $\\dot A(t)=\\mathbf{F}(A)$: The system of ODEs that describes the evolution of the state over time.\n    \\item \\textit{Semiflow} $\\Phi_t(A(0))=A(t),t\\ge 0$: The map that takes an initial state $A(0)$ and a time $t$ to the future state $A(t)$. Its existence is guaranteed because $\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous and $|A|$ can never blow up in finite time \\citep{Robinson2001}\\footnote{The rigorous proof is omitted. The Lipschitz property follows from that fact that $K*A$ is bounded and $T$ is Lipschitz. $|A|$ is bounded because it can at most grow/shrink exponentially.}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWith the above definitions in place, we can discuss the following properties of the dynamical system.\n\n\\textit{Dissipativity}: A semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative if there exists a bounded set $\\mathcal{B} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every initial condition $A(0)\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is absorbed into $\\mathcal{B}$ in a finite time $t^*$.\n\n\\textit{Global Attractor}: If a semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative, then there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ which is the minimal set onto which all trajectories converge as $t\\to\\infty$. The attractor entirely contains the long-term behavior of the system after transients have died away. A global attractor also guarantees at least one invariant measure on the attractor, letting us take physically meaningful integrals over the attractor. \n\n\\textit{Fractal Dimension}: Dissipative chaotic dynamical systems tend to settle to attractors which integrate to zero phase space volume but cannot be represented as an integer-dimensional manifold. These are called fractal attractors, and they are characterized by their fractal dimension. Fractal dimension approximately represents the number of degrees of freedom in a given set, and there are several relevant definitions for fractal dimension. We focus on specific cases of the generalized dimensions introduced by \\citet{Grassberger1983}. They are defined as:\n\n\\[\nD_q = \\frac{1}{1-q} \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\frac{\\log (\\sum_{i} p_i^q)}{\\log (1/\\varepsilon)},\n\\]\n\n\\noindent where $p_i$ is the total mass in the $i$-th box in a uniform partition of phase space with some resolution $\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\textit{box-counting dimension}, $D_1$ is the \\textit{information dimension}, and $D_2$ is the \\textit{correlation dimension}. These only differ when the distribution of density on the attractor is non-uniform.\n\n\\textit{Lyapunov Exponents}: The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are defined as the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. If there exists at least one positive Lyapunov exponent, then we call the system chaotic because nearby trajectories exponentially diverge. There exist several definitions for LEs (see \\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020} for a comprehensive overview), but the one which applies best to our setting is: \n\\[\n\\lambda_i(A(0))=\\limsup_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\log \\sigma_i(A(0),t),\n\\]\n\\noindent where $\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\nabla_A \\Phi_t(A)$. These exponents can be approximated numerically using the method presented by \\citet{Benettin1980}. Furthermore, the covariant Lyapunov vectors, which encode the associated perturbation directions for each exponent, can be calculated easily with a short backwards pass after applying Benettin's method \\citep{Ginelli2007}.\n\n\\textit{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension}: The Kaplan-Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ is a heuristic upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor. Experimentally, it has been shown to closely estimate $D_1$, except in rare edge cases (see discussion in \\citep{Groger2013}). It is defined as\n\\[\nD_{KY}=j + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^j \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{j+1}|},\n\\]\n\\noindent where $j$ is the largest index such that the cumulative sum of the largest $j$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative.\n\n\\section{Mathematical Results}\n\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\n\nAs explained in the Background section, \\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the action of the group $G=SE(2)\\times\\mathbb{R}$. This corresponding Lie algebra is:\n\\[\n\\mathfrak g=\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb R}\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y, x\\partial_y-y\\partial_x, \\partial_t\\}\n\\]\n\nUsing these symmetries, we can derive conditions under which specific forms of solutions exist. We refer to these as \\textit{symmetry solutions}, and we can express them with the ansatz $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0$, where $\\gamma \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ and $A_0=A(\\mathbf{x},0)$. This ansatz becomes a solution when the following equation is satisfied:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\partial_t\\left[e^{t \\gamma} A_0\\right] &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, K * (e^{t \\gamma} A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma\\,e^{t \\gamma} A_0                &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, e^{t \\gamma}(K*A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\gamma A_0                &= e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma A_0                              &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\label{stationary_cond}\n\\end{align}\n\nFrom the second to third line, we use the $G$-equivariance property of $\\mathbf{F}$. We also use the fact that $e^{t\\gamma}$ commutes with $\\gamma$ and $K$ and has an inverse operator $e^{-t\\gamma}$. These facts are not trivial and are a direct consequence of the specific form of the PDE. \n\nA key result of \\eqref{stationary_cond} is that no evolution is required to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{v}t,0)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0,\\,\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we need only find an initial field $A_0$ such that \\eqref{stationary_cond} is satisfied with $\\gamma=-\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}\\partial_x\\,\\, \\partial_y\\end{bmatrix}^\\top$. A similar argument applies to rotating solutions and steady state solutions. Note that since $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{0}, K*\\mathbf{0})=\\mathbf{0}$, a trivial solution to \\eqref{stationary_cond} always exists. \n\nThere is also an important connection between the Lie algebra and the Lyapunov exponents of the system. Theorem 2.15 of \\citet{Aston1994} showed that for $G$-equivariant flows, the number of Lyapunov exponents equal to zero is $\\dim\\{G\\} - \\dim\\{g \\in G\\,|\\,g\\!\\cdot\\!A=A\\}$. In our case, the number of zero exponents equals 4 minus the number of independent continuous symmetries that leave the solution unchanged. For example, a purely translating solution will have at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents because one dimension of the symmetry group (corresponding to translation in the direction of motion combined with an appropriate time shift) acts trivially on the solution.\n\n\\subsection{Dissipativity and Existence of a Global Attractor}\n\nIn this section, we prove a fundamental property of Asymptotic Lenia: all trajectories remain bounded within a finite region of phase space and eventually converge to a common attractor. This property, known as dissipativity, is crucial for understanding the long-term behavior of the system and ensures that the complexity we observe is constrained within a well-defined mathematical structure.\n\nUsing the formal definition from \\cite{Robinson2001}, we can show that discretized Asymptotic Lenia is a dissipative semiflow.  For some $\\varepsilon > 0$, consider the compact set $\\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon=[0-\\varepsilon,1+\\varepsilon]^{N^2} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$, $M(t)=\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. If we choose the initial condition $A[i,j](0)\\in \\mathcal{X}$ and assume $0\\le T(\\cdot)\\le 1$, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{dM}{dt} &= T((K*A)[i_M,j_M]) - M \\le 1 - M \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies M(t) \\le 1 + \\bigl(M(0)-1\\bigr)e^{-t} \\\\[8pt]\n    \\frac{dm}{dt} &= T((K*A)[i_m,j_m]) - m \\ge -m \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies m(t) \\ge m(0)\\,e^{-t}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\noindent where $(i_M,j_M)$ and $(i_m,j_m)$ are the indices of the maximum and minimum values of $A[i,j](t)$ respectively. Therefore, after a finite time\n\n\\[\nt^*= \\max\\left\\{\\ln\\left|\\frac{M(0)-1}{\\varepsilon}\\right|, \\ln\\left|\\frac{m(0)}{\\varepsilon}\\right|\\right\\},\n\\]\nwe must have $A[i,j](t)\\in \\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon,\\, \\forall\\, t \\ge t^*$. We can conclude that there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$. A very similar argument can be used to show that the full PDE is also dissipative, but this is not necessary for our purposes. We can now inquire about the kinds of behavior we expect to see on the attractor. \n\n\\subsection{Helmholtz Decomposition and Behavior on the Attractor}\n\nIn this section, we analyze the mathematical structure of the Asymptotic Lenia dynamics to understand why it can produce complex behaviors such as chaos and periodic oscillations. We show that the system can be decomposed into two fundamental components: a divergence-free (rotational) part and a gradient part. This decomposition, known as the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, reveals why Asymptotic Lenia can exhibit rich dynamics rather than simply settling into static patterns. We start by calculating the Jacobian of $\\mathbf{F}$ from \\eqref{discrete_asymptotic_lenia} as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)}{\\partial A[k,l]} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[k,l]} \\left[T((K*A)[i,j]) - A[i,j]\\right]\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, \\frac{\\partial (K*A)[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]} -  \\frac{\\partial A[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]}\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, K[i-k,j-l] - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}\n\\end{align*}\n\nImposing $K[0,0]$, the divergence of the first term becomes zero so the divergence comes entirely from summing the Kronecker delta terms, giving $\\nabla_A \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = -N^2$. This means that we can write $\\mathbf{F}$ as the sum of a divergence-free term and a term which is the gradient of a scalar potential:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = \\underbrace{T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right)}_{\\text{divergence-free}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[i,j]} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,l} A^2[k,l]\\right]}_{\\text{gradient}}\n\\]\n\nSuch a decomposition is known as a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition \\citep{hhd2013}. We do not comment on the uniqueness of the decomposition due to the possibility for harmonic components, but we can infer that $\\mathbf{F}$ cannot be the gradient of a scalar function. This is because for any arbitrary pair of indices $(i,j)\\ne (k,l)$, the entries of the Jacobian are not necessarily equal due to nonlinearity of $T$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/lyap.png}\n    \\caption{Lyapunov spectra of the four classes of solutions shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. On the left, we plot the values of the top 10 Lyapunov exponents for each solution class. On the right, we plot the values of of the exponents over time to show convergence. The Kaplan-Yorke dimension is calculated based on the values of these exponents and shown in the titles.}\n    \\label{fig:lyap_spectrum}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe stress that this result is crucial for the existence of chaotic or periodic dynamics on attractors. While trajectories of a pure gradient flow are not guaranteed to reach a steady state, they are guaranteed to enter and remain in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the set of steady states \\citep{Hale1988,Robinson2001}. The classic neighbor-sum + non-linearity rule turns out to be exactly the right kind of term to allow for complex behavior.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/clv.png}\n    \\caption{Covariant Lyapunov vectors of the chaotic soliton.

The top 10 CLVs are visualized on the right, where blue and red correspond to negative and positive values respectively.}\n    \\label{fig:clv}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Experimental Results}\n\nHaving established the theoretical framework for analyzing Asymptotic Lenia, we now empirically measure key quantities to characterize the complexity of different solution classes. Our theoretical analysis predicted that chaotic solutions should exhibit a global attractor with fractal dimension between 4 and $N^2$, with the exact dimension reflecting the system's complexity. Here, we verify these predictions by calculating LEs and the corresponding Kaplan-Yorke dimension for representative solutions from each class identified in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.\n\nLEs are calculated for the spatially-discretized flow using the method first proposed by \\citet{Benettin1980}. In particular, we integrate a set of $k$ orthogonal vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ along the linearized flow $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_i=\\nabla_A \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{v}_i$ and repeatedly apply QR decomposition to ensure orthogonality. \\citet{Benettin1980} showed that the top $k$ exponents equal the time average of the logarithmic growth of the tangent vectors' norms between successive applications of QR decomposition. These top $k$ LEs can then be plugged into the Kaplan-Yorke formula to obtain an upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra for four distinct solution classes are shown in \\cref{fig:lyap_spectrum}. We calculate these with a spatial discretization of $N=256$ and a time step of $\\Delta t=0.1$. After an initial transient period, we run a forward pass for 100000 steps and then a backwards pass for 10000 steps to calculate the LEs and CLVs. Since the tangent vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ are initialized randomly and take time to converge, we only average over the last 50000 steps to obtain the finite-time LEs.\n\nAs predicted, the purely rotating and translating solutions have 3 zero LEs, while the chaotic and periodic solutions have 4 zero LEs. Intuitively, in all but the chaotic case, the top LEs are all zero, making $D_{KY}$ exactly equal to the number of zero LEs. When the top LEs are all close to zero, the $D_{KY}$ formula is sensitive to tiny differences in the values, so in practice we round all $|\\lambda_i|<0.001$ to zero. For the chaotic soliton, we found that it had a Kaplan-Yorke dimension of approximately 8.46, with two signficant positive LEs.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra help explain the remarkable robustness to perturbation we observe in practice. Since all but a few of the $N^2$ LEs are negative (with a mean of -1), the system exponentially decays most modes of a random perturbation. In \\cref{fig:clv}, we visualize the unstable, neutral, and stable modes by calculating the covariant Lypaunov vectors (CLVs) for the chaotic soliton. It is important to note that the CLVs are not necessarily orthogonal, and in this case they certainly are not. We also observe that within the set of neutral CLVs, $\\lambda_4$ and $\\lambda_6$ are approximately identical. This is because they theoretically correspond to the same exponent so the CLVs span a degenerate subspace that has no unique decomposition \\citep{Ginelli2013}.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nIn the previous section, we verified that the number of zero LEs matched the theoretically predicted quantity and that chaotic patterns indeed exhibit at least one positive LE and $D_{KY}>4$. The calculation of the LEs was relatively computationally inexpensive and the results were easy to interpret. Compared to other methods of estimating fractal dimension, this ``Lyapunov analysis'' is uniquely effective for reasons we will discuss next.\n\n\\subsection{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension as a Measure of Complexity}\nBoth the box-counting dimension and correlation dimension are impractical measures of fractal dimension for finely discretized PDEs. Box-counting dimension requires constructing histograms with $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-N^2})$ bins, where $\\varepsilon$ is the bin size. Correlation dimension requires calculating the pairwise distance between all sampled fields $A[i,j](n\\Delta t)$ on a trajectory, which is expensive but tractable for moderate $N$ and trajectory lengths. However, convergence is slow because the method relies on sampling many points from the tail of the power-law distance distribution. Experimentally, we also found that log-log plots of the pairwise distance distribution did not have a uniquely identifiable linear region, making the correlation dimension difficult to interpret unambiguously. On the other hand, the Kaplan-Yorke dimension requires just a constant number of Jacobian-vector product operations and QR decompositions to be carried out at each timestep of the state evolution. Even for chaotic attractors, we found in our experiments that convergence to within $1\\%$ of the long-time estimate of $D_{KY}$ required only $\\sim 10^4$ timesteps at $\\Delta t=0.1$. \n\nAdditionally, information dimension (upper bounded by $D_{KY}$) offers the most intuitive interpretation of fractal dimension. It tells us how many bits of information are needed to describe any state on the attractor for a given resolution. Equivalently, we can think of information dimension as answering \\textit{how many real numbers are needed to encode the state} as opposed to how many binary numbers---i.e. entropy. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is the most practical and informative measure of complexity for Continuous Cellular Automata. \n\nWe suggest that future works on Continuous and Neural CAs use $D_{KY}$ to quantify the complexity of patterns they discover. Next, we discuss how we can systematically search for higher complexity in CCAs.\n\n\\subsection{Generalizing CCAs}\nWe begin by summarizing the mathematical predictions, and the minimal assumptions from which we derived them. This is shown in \\cref{tab:assumptions} below.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\\linewidth}p{0.5\\linewidth}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Assumption} & \\textbf{Resulting Prediction} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\partial_t A =T(K*A)-A$,\\newline $K$ radially symmetric. & Possibility of symmetry solutions and up to four $\\lambda_i=0$. \\\\\n\\midrule\n$0 \\le T(\\cdot) \\le 1$,\\newline $T$ Lipschitz continuous & Existence of global attractor. \\\\ \n\\midrule\n$K[0,0] = 0$ & $\\dim \\mathcal{A} < N^2$. Not a gradient flow, possibility of dynamic attractors. \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Summary of key assumptions and their mathematical implications for Asymptotic Lenia dynamics.}\n\\label{tab:assumptions}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe listed assumptions alone do not guarantee the existence of a chaotic attractor. However, we know that at least one choice of $T$ and $K$ satisfying the assumptions does produce a chaotic attractor because Asymptotic Lenia is a known example. We also know that Asymptotic Lenia does span the entire set of such CCAs. The parameterization of $T$ and $K$ via the parameter set $\\{\\mu, \\sigma\\}\\cup \\{\\beta_i\\}$ is just one low-dimensional parameterization of the space of functions satisfying the listed assumptions. \n\nWe could stop there, and suggest that there are many other forms of $T$ and $K$ which exhibit similar kinds of chaotic behavior. However, we aim to find a broader class of CCAs which might exhibit new types of complex behavior like replication, reproduction, or goal-directedness. We suggest that the following general formulation of CCAs be explored in future work:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = f(K*A) - \\nabla_A G(A),\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $K$ is bounded, radially symmetric, and zero at the origin, and $f$ is a Lipschitz continuous nonlinear function such that $0 \\le f(\\cdot) \\le 1$. If we require $G$ be a convex function with no minimizers outside $[0,1]^{N^2}$ and $\\nabla_A G(\\mathbf{1}) \\ge \\mathbf{1}$, we can guarantee both dissipativity and nonpositive divergence. This follows from a similar argument to the one made in the mathematical results section, but we omit the proof. In this formulation, the divergence is still negative since it is the Laplacian of a convex function, but it will also be nonuniform over the phase space. We suspect that nonuniform divergence may be enough for highly multifractal attractors to emerge, leading to novel forms of complexity.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have shown that the mathematical framework of dynamical systems theory can be rigorously applied to Asymptotic Lenia, and that it provides a powerful set of tools for understanding complexity in a broader class of CCAs. We introduced Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension as fundamental concepts and provided a simple open-source implementation of the algorithm used to calculate them. This allowed us to experimentally verify that just a few key properties of the system are sufficient to enable chaotic behavior. Using these properties, we proposed a generalization of CCAs which we believe may contain new forms of complexity which cannot be characterized by a single Lyapunov spectrum.\n\nFor future work, we suggest that the full infinite-dimensional dynamical systems framework be applied to our general CCA formulation. In particular, we are very interested in an extended theoretical framework which could explain and predict phenomena like replication, reproduction, and goal-directedness. We also strongly encourage future works in continuous-time artificial life simulations like neural cellular automata to quantify the complexity of their systems using the Lyapunov analysis presented here.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}Support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number RGPIN-2019-04669 is gratefully acknowledged.\nCette recherche a \\'et\\'e financ\\'ee par le Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en g\\'enie du Canada (CRSNG), num\\'ero de r\\'ef\\'erence RGPIN-2019-04669.

Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan-Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n% Choose one of: Full Paper, Summaries, or Late Breaking Abstracts \nSubmission type: \\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\n\n% If sharing code / data, anonymize your repository and paste the link here.\n% Example of anonymizing sevice for github: https://anonymous.4open.science/\n% delete this line if not needed\nData/Code available at: \\url{http://will.add.later}\n\n\\section{Background}\\label{sec:background}\n\n\\subsection{Continuous Cellular Automata}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\n    \\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, which exist in distinct regions of the PDE's parameter space. The \\textit{soliton} is a stable, purely translating solution. The \\textit{rotator} is a stable, purely rotating solution. The \\textit{periodic soliton} is a translating solution which also oscillates periodically. The \\textit{chaotic soliton} exhibits a chaotic combination of translations, rotations, and internal oscillations.}\n    \\label{fig:lenia_zoo}\n\\end{figure}\n\nContinuous cellular automata (CCAs) were initially invented to recreate the complex emergent behavior of the program known as Conway's Game of Life \\citep{Gardner1970}, with the hope of finding more life-like patterns. In the search for complexity, CAs gradually evolved towards a pure (non-local) partial differential equation (PDE) formulation. ``Larger than life'' \\citep{Evans2001} increased the size of the kernel, SmoothLife \\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, Lenia \\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally Asymptotic Lenia \\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this total transition from lookup table to PDE, the methods for analyzing these systems have seen very little progress. As a result, the field has largely retained the intuition that emergent complexity has no simple causal explanation.\n\nIn this paper, we show that transitioning to a PDE model of CCAs allows us to import well-established mathematical concepts from dynamical systems theory. We first introduce the main concepts: symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimension, and more. Using these concepts, we establish a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure the relevant quantities to obtain a complete characterization of the complexity of solutions. Finally, we suggest a specific quantity for measuring complexity in CCAs and summarize the small set of key properties which are sufficient for a broader class of CCAs to exhibit complex behavior.\n\n\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\n\nOur analysis centers around the Asymptotic Lenia system since it is the only CCA discovered thus far that is defined as a continuous PDE \\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions to the PDE are shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\citet{alenia2021} as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\mathbf{F}(A,K*A) = T(K*A) - A, \\label{asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $A \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued 2-D scalar field, $K \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ is the 2-D convolution operator, and $T \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function, applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}(u-\\mu)^2/\\sigma^2)$ is parameterized by $0<\\sigma \\ll \\mu$, and is typically approximated via a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\mathbf{x})=K(\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2)$ is composed of a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r)=(4r(r-1))^4$ with parameters $\\{\\beta_i\\}$ controlling the scaling of the rings, and $R$ controlling the overall spatial scale. Importantly, $K(0)=0$ and $K$ is normalized such that $\\int_{\\Omega} K(\\mathbf{x})\\,d\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume that the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe also define the spatially-discretized version of Asymptotic Lenia, which is a finite-dimensional (ODE) approximation of the PDE, and is closer to the true numerical implementation of the system. At each discrete point in space $(i,j) \\in [0,N-1]^2$, we define a function of time $A[i,j](t)\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The field's dynamics are given by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d}{dt} A[i,j](t) = \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right) - A[i,j]. \\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\n\nTo analyze Asymptotic Lenia, we seek a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of fields---functions of space---over time. This is the subject of the theory of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. In this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to the finite-dimensional setting because it makes our results easier to follow, without loss of generality. A fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment of CCAs is beyond the scope of this paper, but we do borrow one important concept: symmetry.\n\nA \\textit{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions \\citep{Olver1986}. If the transformation depends on a single continuous parameter (e.g. a shift by $\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is called a \\textit{continuous symmetry}. Continuous symmetries can be organized into a \\textit{Lie group}. An example of a Lie group is the set of rotations and translations on a 2-D plane $SE(2)$. The associated set of infinitesimal transformations is called the \\textit{Lie algebra} and it is composed of the \\textit{generators} of the group. For example, the generators for translation in the $x$-direction is $\\partial_x$ and the generator for rotation is $x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x$. All 2-D CCAs are invariant under the action of the group $SE(2)$ because the update rule is identical across all of space, and the non-local component is only a function of radial distance. They are also invariant under time translation since the update rule is autonomous, meaning it is independent of time.\n\nNow, we describe the finite-dimensional setting for dynamical systems theory in the language of \\citep[e.g.,][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}. The definitions are mapped to discretized Asymptotic Lenia as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{Phase Space}: $\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$: The set of all possible states of the system. \n    \\item \\textit{Evolution Law}: $\\dot A(t)=\\mathbf{F}(A)$: The system of ODEs that describes the evolution of the state over time.\n    \\item \\textit{Semiflow} $\\Phi_t(A(0))=A(t),t\\ge 0$: The map that takes an initial state $A(0)$ and a time $t$ to the future state $A(t)$. Its existence is guaranteed because $\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous and $|A|$ can never blow up in finite time \\citep{Robinson2001}\\footnote{The rigorous proof is omitted. The Lipschitz property follows from that fact that $K*A$ is bounded and $T$ is Lipschitz. $|A|$ is bounded because it can at most grow/shrink exponentially.}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWith the above definitions in place, we can discuss the following properties of the dynamical system.\n\n\\textit{Dissipativity}: A semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative if there exists a bounded set $\\mathcal{B} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every initial condition $A(0)\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is absorbed into $\\mathcal{B}$ in a finite time $t^*$.\n\n\\textit{Global Attractor}: If a semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative, then there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ which is the minimal set onto which all trajectories converge as $t\\to\\infty$. The attractor entirely contains the long-term behavior of the system after transients have died away. A global attractor also guarantees at least one invariant measure on the attractor, letting us take physically meaningful integrals over the attractor. \n\n\\textit{Fractal Dimension}: Dissipative chaotic dynamical systems tend to settle to attractors which integrate to zero phase space volume but cannot be represented as an integer-dimensional manifold. These are called fractal attractors, and they are characterized by their fractal dimension. Fractal dimension approximately represents the number of degrees of freedom in a given set, and there are several relevant definitions for fractal dimension. We focus on specific cases of the generalized dimensions introduced by \\citet{Grassberger1983}. They are defined as:\n\n\\[\nD_q = \\frac{1}{1-q} \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\frac{\\log (\\sum_{i} p_i^q)}{\\log (1/\\varepsilon)},\n\\]\n\n\\noindent where $p_i$ is the total mass in the $i$-th box in a uniform partition of phase space with some resolution $\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\textit{box-counting dimension}, $D_1$ is the \\textit{information dimension}, and $D_2$ is the \\textit{correlation dimension}. These only differ when the distribution of density on the attractor is non-uniform.\n\n\\textit{Lyapunov Exponents}: The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are defined as the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. If there exists at least one positive Lyapunov exponent, then we call the system chaotic because nearby trajectories exponentially diverge. There exist several definitions for LEs (see \\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020} for a comprehensive overview), but the one that applies best to our setting is: \n\\[\n\\lambda_i(A(0))=\\limsup_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\log \\sigma_i(A(0),t),\n\\]\n\\noindent where $\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\nabla_A \\Phi_t(A)$. These exponents can be approximated numerically using the method presented by \\citet{Benettin1980}. Furthermore, the covariant Lyapunov vectors, which encode the associated perturbation directions for each exponent, can be calculated easily with a short backwards pass after applying Benettin's method \\citep{Ginelli2007}.\n\n\\textit{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension}: The Kaplan-Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ is a heuristic upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor. Experimentally, it has been shown to closely estimate $D_1$, except in rare edge cases (see discussion in \\citep{Groger2013}). It is defined as\n\\[\nD_{KY}=j + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^j \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{j+1}|},\n\\]\n\\noindent where $j$ is the largest index such that the cumulative sum of the largest $j$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative.\n\n\\section{Mathematical Results}\n\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\n\nAs explained in the Background section, \\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the action of the group $G=SE(2)\\times\\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding Lie algebra is:\n\\[\n\\mathfrak g=\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb R}\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y, x\\partial_y-y\\partial_x, \\partial_t\\}\n\\]\n\nUsing these symmetries, we can derive conditions under which specific forms of solutions exist. We refer to these as \\textit{symmetry solutions}, and we can express them with the ansatz $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0$, where $\\gamma \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ and $A_0=A(\\mathbf{x},0)$. This ansatz becomes a solution when the following equation is satisfied:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\partial_t\\left[e^{t \\gamma} A_0\\right] &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, K * (e^{t \\gamma} A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma\\,e^{t \\gamma} A_0                &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, e^{t \\gamma}(K*A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\gamma A_0                &= e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma A_0                              &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\label{stationary_cond}\n\\end{align}\n\nFrom the second to third line, we use the $G$-equivariance property of $\\mathbf{F}$. We also use the fact that $e^{t\\gamma}$ commutes with $\\gamma$ and $K$ and has an inverse operator $e^{-t\\gamma}$. These facts are not trivial and are a direct consequence of the specific form of the PDE. \n\nA key result of \\eqref{stationary_cond} is that no evolution is required to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{v}t,0)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0,\\,\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we need only find an initial field $A_0$ such that \\eqref{stationary_cond} is satisfied with $\\gamma=-\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}\\partial_x\\,\\, \\partial_y\\end{bmatrix}^\\top$. A similar argument applies to rotating solutions and steady state solutions. Note that since $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{0}, K*\\mathbf{0})=\\mathbf{0}$, a trivial solution to \\eqref{stationary_cond} always exists. \n\nThere is also an important connection between the Lie algebra and the Lyapunov exponents of the system. Theorem 2.15 of \\citet{Aston1994} showed that for $G$-equivariant flows, the number of Lyapunov exponents equal to zero is $\\dim\\{G\\} - \\dim\\{g \\in G\\,|\\,g\\!\\cdot\\!A=A\\}$. In our case, the number of zero exponents equals 4 minus the number of independent continuous symmetries that leave the solution unchanged. For example, a purely translating solution will have at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents because one dimension of the symmetry group (corresponding to translation in the direction of motion combined with an appropriate time shift) acts trivially on the solution.\n\n\\subsection{Dissipativity and Existence of a Global Attractor}\n\nIn this section, we prove a fundamental property of Asymptotic Lenia: all trajectories remain bounded within a finite region of phase space and eventually converge to a common attractor. This property, known as dissipativity, is crucial for understanding the long-term behavior of the system and ensures that the complexity we observe is constrained within a well-defined mathematical structure.\n\nUsing the formal definition from \\cite{Robinson2001}, we can show that discretized Asymptotic Lenia is a dissipative semiflow.  For some $\\varepsilon > 0$, consider the compact set $\\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon=[0-\\varepsilon,1+\\varepsilon]^{N^2} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$, $M(t)=\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. If we choose the initial condition $A[i,j](0)\\in \\mathcal{X}$ and assume $0\\le T(\\cdot)\\le 1$, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{dM}{dt} &= T((K*A)[i_M,j_M]) - M \\le 1 - M \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies M(t) \\le 1 + \\bigl(M(0)-1\\bigr)e^{-t} \\\\[8pt]\n    \\frac{dm}{dt} &= T((K*A)[i_m,j_m]) - m \\ge -m \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies m(t) \\ge m(0)\\,e^{-t}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\noindent where $(i_M,j_M)$ and $(i_m,j_m)$ are the indices of the maximum and minimum values of $A[i,j](t)$ respectively. Therefore, after a finite time\n\n\\[\nt^*= \\max\\left\\{\\ln\\left|\\frac{M(0)-1}{\\varepsilon}\\right|, \\ln\\left|\\frac{m(0)}{\\varepsilon}\\right|\\right\\},\n\\]\nwe must have $A[i,j](t)\\in \\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon,\\, \\forall\\, t \\ge t^*$. We can conclude that there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$. A very similar argument can be used to show that the full PDE is also dissipative, but this is not necessary for our purposes. We can now inquire about the kinds of behavior we expect to see on the attractor. \n\n\\subsection{Helmholtz Decomposition and Behavior on the Attractor}\n\nIn this section, we analyze the mathematical structure of the Asymptotic Lenia dynamics to understand why it can produce complex behaviors such as chaos and periodic oscillations. We show that the system can be decomposed into two fundamental components: a divergence-free (rotational) part and a gradient part. This decomposition, known as the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, reveals why Asymptotic Lenia can exhibit rich dynamics rather than simply settling into static patterns. We start by calculating the Jacobian of $\\mathbf{F}$ from \\eqref{discrete_asymptotic_lenia} as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)}{\\partial A[k,l]} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[k,l]} \\left[T((K*A)[i,j]) - A[i,j]\\right]\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, \\frac{\\partial (K*A)[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]} -  \\frac{\\partial A[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]}\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, K[i-k,j-l] - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}\n\\end{align*}\n\nImposing $K[0,0]=0$, the divergence of the first term becomes zero so the divergence comes entirely from summing the Kronecker delta terms, giving $\\nabla_A \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = -N^2$. This means that we can write $\\mathbf{F}$ as the sum of a divergence-free term and a term which is the gradient of a scalar potential:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = \\underbrace{T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right)}_{\\text{divergence-free}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[i,j]} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,l} A^2[k,l]\\right]}_{\\text{gradient}}\n\\]\n\nSuch a decomposition is known as a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition \\citep{hhd2013}. We do not comment on the uniqueness of the decomposition due to the possibility for harmonic components, but we can infer that $\\mathbf{F}$ cannot be the gradient of a scalar function. This is because for any arbitrary pair of indices $(i,j)\\ne (k,l)$, the entries of the Jacobian are not necessarily equal due to nonlinearity of $T$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/lyap.png}\n    \\caption{Lyapunov spectra of the four classes of solutions shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.

While trajectories of a pure gradient flow are not guaranteed to reach a steady state, they are guaranteed to enter and remain in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the set of steady states \\citep{Hale1988,Robinson2001}. The classic neighbor-sum + non-linearity rule turns out to be exactly the right kind of term to allow for complex behavior.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/clv.png}\n    \\caption{Covariant Lyapunov vectors of the chaotic soliton.

The top 10 CLVs are visualized on the right, where blue and red correspond to negative and positive values respectively.}\n    \\label{fig:clv}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Experimental Results}\n\nHaving established the theoretical framework for analyzing Asymptotic Lenia, we now empirically measure key quantities to characterize the complexity of different solution classes. Our theoretical analysis predicted that chaotic solutions should exhibit a global attractor with fractal dimension between 4 and $N^2$, with the exact dimension reflecting the system's complexity. Here, we verify these predictions by calculating LEs and the corresponding Kaplan-Yorke dimension for representative solutions from each class identified in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.\n\nLEs are calculated for the spatially-discretized flow using the method first proposed by \\citet{Benettin1980}. In particular, we integrate a set of $k$ orthogonal vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ along the linearized flow $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_i=\\nabla_A \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{v}_i$ and repeatedly apply QR decomposition to ensure orthogonality. \\citet{Benettin1980} showed that the top $k$ exponents equal the time average of the logarithmic growth of the tangent vectors' norms between successive applications of QR decomposition. These top $k$ LEs can then be plugged into the Kaplan-Yorke formula to obtain an upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra for four distinct solution classes are shown in \\cref{fig:lyap_spectrum}. We calculate these with a spatial discretization of $N=256$ and a time step of $\\Delta t=0.1$. After an initial transient period, we run a forward pass for 100000 steps and then a backwards pass for 10000 steps to calculate the LEs and CLVs. Since the tangent vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ are initialized randomly and take time to converge, we only average over the last 50000 steps to obtain the finite-time LEs.\n\nAs predicted, the purely rotating and translating solutions have 3 zero LEs, while the chaotic and periodic solutions have 4 zero LEs. Intuitively, in all but the chaotic case, the top LEs are all zero, making $D_{KY}$ exactly equal to the number of zero LEs. When the top LEs are all close to zero, the $D_{KY}$ formula is sensitive to tiny differences in the values, so in practice we round all $|\\lambda_i|<0.001$ to zero. For the chaotic soliton, we found that it had a Kaplan-Yorke dimension of approximately 8.46, with two significant positive LEs.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra help explain the remarkable robustness to perturbation we observe in practice. Since all but a few of the $N^2$ LEs are negative (with a mean of -1), the system exponentially decays most modes of a random perturbation. In \\cref{fig:clv}, we visualize the unstable, neutral, and stable modes by calculating the covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) for the chaotic soliton. It is important to note that the CLVs are not necessarily orthogonal, and in this case they certainly are not. We also observe that within the set of neutral CLVs, $\\lambda_4$ and $\\lambda_6$ are approximately identical. This is because they theoretically correspond to the same exponent so the CLVs span a degenerate subspace that has no unique decomposition \\citep{Ginelli2013}.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nIn the previous section, we verified that the number of zero LEs matched the theoretically predicted quantity and that chaotic patterns indeed exhibit at least one positive LE and $D_{KY}>4$. The calculation of the LEs was relatively computationally inexpensive and the results were easy to interpret. Compared to other methods of estimating fractal dimension, this ``Lyapunov analysis'' is uniquely effective for reasons we will discuss next.\n\n\\subsection{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension as a Measure of Complexity}\nBoth the box-counting dimension and correlation dimension are impractical measures of fractal dimension for finely discretized PDEs. Box-counting dimension requires constructing histograms with $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-N^2})$ bins, where $\\varepsilon$ is the bin size. Correlation dimension requires calculating the pairwise distance between all sampled fields $A[i,j](n\\Delta t)$ on a trajectory, which is expensive but tractable for moderate $N$ and trajectory lengths. However, convergence is slow because the method relies on sampling many points from the tail of the power-law distance distribution. Experimentally, we also found that log-log plots of the pairwise distance distribution did not have a uniquely identifiable linear region, making the correlation dimension difficult to interpret unambiguously. On the other hand, the Kaplan-Yorke dimension requires just a constant number of Jacobian-vector product operations and QR decompositions to be carried out at each timestep of the state evolution. Even for chaotic attractors, we found in our experiments that convergence to within 1\\% of the long-time estimate of $D_{KY}$ required only $\\sim 10^4$ timesteps at $\\Delta t=0.1$. \n\nAdditionally, information dimension (upper bounded by $D_{KY}$) offers the most intuitive interpretation of fractal dimension. It tells us how many bits of information are needed to describe any state on the attractor for a given resolution. Equivalently, we can think of information dimension as answering \\textit{how many real numbers are needed to encode the state} as opposed to how many binary numbers---i.e. entropy. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is the most practical and informative measure of complexity for Continuous Cellular Automata. \n\nWe suggest that future works on Continuous and Neural CAs use $D_{KY}$ to quantify the complexity of patterns they discover. Next, we discuss how we can systematically search for higher complexity in CCAs.\n\n\\subsection{Generalizing CCAs}\nWe begin by summarizing the mathematical predictions, and the minimal assumptions from which we derived them. This is shown in \\cref{tab:assumptions} below.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\\linewidth}p{0.5\\linewidth}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Assumption} & \\textbf{Resulting Prediction} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\partial_t A =T(K*A)-A$,\\newline $K$ radially symmetric. & Possibility of symmetry solutions and up to four $\\lambda_i=0$. \\\\\n\\midrule\n$0 \\le T(\\cdot) \\le 1$,\\newline $T$ Lipschitz continuous & Existence of global attractor. \\\\ \n\\midrule\n$K[0,0] = 0$ & $\\dim \\mathcal{A} < N^2$. Not a gradient flow, possibility of dynamic attractors. \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Summary of key assumptions and their mathematical implications for Asymptotic Lenia dynamics.}\n\\label{tab:assumptions}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe listed assumptions alone do not guarantee the existence of a chaotic attractor. However, we know that at least one choice of $T$ and $K$ satisfying the assumptions does produce a chaotic attractor because Asymptotic Lenia is a known example. We also know that Asymptotic Lenia does not span the entire set of such CCAs. The parameterization of $T$ and $K$ via the parameter set $\\{\\mu, \\sigma\\}\\cup \\{\\beta_i\\}$ is just one low-dimensional parameterization of the space of functions satisfying the listed assumptions. \n\nWe could stop there, and suggest that there are many other forms of $T$ and $K$ which exhibit similar kinds of chaotic behavior. However, we aim to find a broader class of CCAs which might exhibit new types of complex behavior like replication, reproduction, or goal-directedness. We suggest that the following general formulation of CCAs be explored in future work:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = f(K*A) - \\nabla_A G(A),\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\noindent where $K$ is bounded, radially symmetric, and zero at the origin, and $f$ is a Lipschitz continuous nonlinear function such that $0 \\le f(\\cdot) \\le 1$. If we require $G$ be a convex function with no minimizers outside $[0,1]^{N^2}$ and $\\nabla_A G(\\mathbf{1}) \\ge \\mathbf{1}$, we can guarantee both dissipativity and nonpositive divergence. This follows from a similar argument to the one made in the mathematical results section, but we omit the proof. In this formulation, the divergence is still negative since it is the Laplacian of a convex function, but it will also be nonuniform over the phase space. We suspect that nonuniform divergence may be enough for highly multifractal attractors to emerge, leading to novel forms of complexity.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have shown that the mathematical framework of dynamical systems theory can be rigorously applied to Asymptotic Lenia, and that it provides a powerful set of tools for understanding complexity in a broader class of CCAs. We introduced Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension as fundamental concepts and provided a simple open-source implementation of the algorithm used to calculate them. This allowed us to experimentally verify that just a few key properties of the system are sufficient to enable chaotic behavior. Using these properties, we proposed a generalization of CCAs which we believe may contain new forms of complexity which cannot be characterized by a single Lyapunov spectrum.\n\nFor future work, we suggest that the full infinite-dimensional dynamical systems framework be applied to our general CCA formulation. In particular, we are very interested in an extended theoretical framework which could explain and predict phenomena like replication, reproduction, and goal-directedness. We also strongly encourage future works in continuous-time artificial life simulations like neural cellular automata to quantify the complexity of their systems using the Lyapunov analysis presented here.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}Support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number RGPIN-2019-04669 is gratefully acknowledged.\nCette recherche a \\'et\\'e financ\\'ee par le Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en g\\'enie du Canada (CRSNG), num\\'ero de r\\'ef\\'erence RGPIN-2019-04669.

Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical-systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan--Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.\\n\\\\end{abstract}\\n\\n% Choose one of: Full Paper, Summaries, or Late Breaking Abstracts \\nSubmission type: \\\\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\\\\\\n\\n% If sharing code / data, anonymize your repository and paste the link here.\\n% Example of anonymizing sevice for github: https://anonymous.4open.science/\\n% delete this line if not needed\\nData/Code available at: \\\\url{http://will.add.later}\\n\\n\\\\section{Background}\\\\label{sec:background}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Continuous Cellular Automata}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[ht]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\\n    \\\\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, which exist in distinct regions of the PDE's parameter space.

The \\\\textit{chaotic soliton} exhibits a chaotic combination of translations, rotations, and internal oscillations.}\\n    \\\\label{fig:lenia_zoo}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nContinuous cellular automata (CCAs) were initially invented to recreate the complex emergent behavior of the program known as Conway's Game of Life \\\\citep{Gardner1970}, with the hope of finding more life-like patterns. In the search for complexity, CAs gradually evolved toward a pure (non-local) partial differential equation (PDE) formulation. ``Larger than life'' \\\\citep{Evans2001} increased the size of the kernel, SmoothLife \\\\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, Lenia \\\\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally Asymptotic Lenia \\\\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this complete transition from lookup table to PDE, analytical methods have seen very little progress, and the field has generally continued to assume that emergent complexity has no simple causal explanation.\\n\\nIn this paper, we show that transitioning to a PDE model of CCAs allows us to import well-established mathematical concepts from dynamical-systems theory. We introduce the main concepts: symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimension. Using these concepts, we establish a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure the relevant quantities to obtain a complete characterization of the complexity of solutions. Finally, we suggest a specific quantity for measuring complexity in CCAs and summarize the small set of key properties that are sufficient for a broader class of CCAs to exhibit complex behavior.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\\n\\nOur analysis centers on the Asymptotic Lenia system since it is, to date, the only CCA defined as a continuous PDE \\\\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions to the PDE are shown in \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\\\citet{alenia2021} as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\partial_t A(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\mathbf{F}(A,K*A) = T(K*A) - A, \\\\label{asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\noindent where $A \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^+ \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued 2-D scalar field, $K \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ denotes 2-D convolution, and $T \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\\\exp(-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(u-\\\\mu)^2/\\\\sigma^2)$ is parameterized by $0<\\\\sigma \\\\ll \\\\mu$ and is typically approximated via a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\\\mathbf{x})=K(\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|_2)$ comprises a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r)=(4r(r-1))^4$ with parameters $\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\}$ controlling the scaling of the rings and $R$ controlling the overall spatial scale. Importantly, $K(0)=0$ and $K$ is normalized such that $\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} K(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\,d\\\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume that the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.\\n\\nWe also define the spatially discretized version of Asymptotic Lenia, which is a finite-dimensional (ODE) approximation of the PDE and is closer to the true numerical implementation of the system. At each discrete point in space $(i,j) \\\\in [0,N-1]^2$, we define a function of time $A[i,j](t)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. The field's dynamics are given by:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} A[i,j](t) = \\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = T\\\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\\\right) - A[i,j]. \\\\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\\n\\nTo analyze Asymptotic Lenia, we seek a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of fields\u2014functions of space\u2014over time. This is the subject of infinite-dimensional dynamical-systems theory. In this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to the finite-dimensional setting because it makes our results easier to follow without loss of generality. A fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment of CCAs is beyond the scope of this paper, but we do borrow one important concept: symmetry.\\n\\nA \\\\textit{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions \\\\citep{Olver1986}. If the transformation depends on a single continuous parameter (e.g., a shift by $\\\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is called a \\\\textit{continuous symmetry}. Continuous symmetries can be organized into a \\\\textit{Lie group}. An example of a Lie group is the set of rotations and translations on a 2-D plane $SE(2)$. The associated set of infinitesimal transformations is called the \\\\textit{Lie algebra} and it is composed of the \\\\textit{generators} of the group. For example, the generator for translation in the $x$-direction is $\\\\partial_x$, and the generator for rotation is $x\\\\partial_y - y\\\\partial_x$. All 2-D CCAs are invariant under the action of the group $SE(2)$ because the update rule is identical across all of space, and the non-local component depends only on radial distance. They are also invariant under time translation since the update rule is autonomous, meaning it is independent of time.\\n\\nNow, we describe the finite-dimensional setting for dynamical-systems theory in the language of \\\\citep[e.g.,][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}. The definitions are mapped to discretized Asymptotic Lenia as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Phase Space}: $\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$\u2014the set of all possible states of the system.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Evolution Law}: $\\\\dot A(t)=\\\\mathbf{F}(A)$\u2014the system of ODEs that describes the evolution of the state over time.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Semiflow} $\\\\Phi_t(A(0))=A(t),\\\\,t\\\\ge 0$\u2014the map that takes an initial state $A(0)$ and a time $t$ to the future state $A(t)$. Its existence is guaranteed because $\\\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous and $|A|$ can never blow up in finite time \\\\citep{Robinson2001}\\\\footnote{The rigorous proof is omitted. The Lipschitz property follows from the fact that $K*A$ is bounded and $T$ is Lipschitz. $|A|$ is bounded because it can at most grow or shrink exponentially.}.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nWith the above definitions in place, we can discuss the following properties of the dynamical system.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Dissipativity}: A semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ over $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative if there exists a bounded set $\\\\mathcal{B} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every initial condition $A(0)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is absorbed into $\\\\mathcal{B}$ in finite time $t^*$.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Global Attractor}: If a semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ over $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative, then there exists a global attractor $\\\\mathcal{A}$, which is the minimal set onto which all trajectories converge as $t\\\\to\\\\infty$. The attractor entirely contains the long-term behavior of the system after transients have died away. A global attractor also guarantees at least one invariant measure on the attractor, allowing physically meaningful integrals.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Fractal Dimension}: Dissipative chaotic dynamical systems tend to settle to attractors that integrate to zero phase-space volume yet cannot be represented as an integer-dimensional manifold. These \\\\textit{fractal attractors} are characterized by their fractal dimension. Fractal dimension approximately represents the number of degrees of freedom in a given set, and there are several relevant definitions. We focus on specific cases of the generalized dimensions introduced by \\\\citet{Grassberger1983}:\\n\\\\[\\nD_q = \\\\frac{1}{1-q} \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\bigl(\\\\sum_{i} p_i^q\\\\bigr)}{\\\\log (1/\\\\varepsilon)},\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $p_i$ is the total mass in the $i$-th box in a uniform partition of phase space with resolution $\\\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\\\textit{box-counting dimension}, $D_1$ the \\\\textit{information dimension}, and $D_2$ the \\\\textit{correlation dimension}. These differ only when the density distribution on the attractor is non-uniform.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Lyapunov Exponents}: The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\}_{i=1}^n$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are defined as the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. If there is at least one positive Lyapunov exponent, the system is chaotic because nearby trajectories diverge exponentially. Several definitions exist (see \\\\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020}), but the one most suitable here is\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\lambda_i(A(0))=\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\log \\\\sigma_i(A(0),t),\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $\\\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\\\nabla_A \\\\Phi_t(A)$. These exponents can be approximated numerically using the method of \\\\citet{Benettin1980}. The corresponding covariant Lyapunov vectors, which encode the associated perturbation directions, can then be obtained with a short backward pass \\\\citep{Ginelli2007}.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Kaplan--Yorke Dimension}: The Kaplan--Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ is a heuristic upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor. Experimentally, it closely estimates $D_1$ except in rare edge cases (see \\\\citealp{Groger2013}). It is defined as\\n\\\\[\\nD_{KY}=j + \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^j \\\\lambda_i}{|\\\\lambda_{j+1}|},\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $j$ is the largest index such that the cumulative sum of the largest $j$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative.\\n\\n\\\\section{Mathematical Results}\\n\\\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\\n\\nAs explained in the Background section, \\\\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the action of the group $G=SE(2)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding Lie algebra is\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathfrak g=\\\\operatorname{span}_{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\{\\\\partial_x, \\\\partial_y, x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x, \\\\partial_t\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nUsing these symmetries, we derive conditions under which specific forms of solutions exist. We refer to these as \\\\textit{symmetry solutions}, and we express them with the ansatz $A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t \\\\gamma}A_0$, where $\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}$ and $A_0=A(\\\\mathbf{x},0)$. This ansatz becomes a solution when the following equation is satisfied:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n    \\\\partial_t\\\\bigl[e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0\\\\bigr] &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0, K * (e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0)\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma\\\\,e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0                &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0, e^{t \\\\gamma}(K*A_0)\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    e^{t \\\\gamma}\\\\,\\\\gamma A_0                &= e^{t \\\\gamma}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(A_0, K*A_0\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma A_0                              &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(A_0, K*A_0\\\\bigr). \\\\label{stationary_cond}\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\nFrom the second to third line we use the $G$-equivariance property of $\\\\mathbf{F}$. We also use the fact that $e^{t\\\\gamma}$ commutes with $\\\\gamma$ and $K$ and has an inverse operator $e^{-t\\\\gamma}$. These facts are nontrivial and follow directly from the specific form of the PDE.\\n\\nA key result of \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} is that no evolution is required to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution $A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{v}t,0)=e^{t \\\\gamma}A_0$ with $\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2$, we need only find an initial field $A_0$ such that \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} is satisfied with $\\\\gamma=-\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\partial_x\\\\,\\\\, \\\\partial_y\\\\end{bmatrix}^\\\\top$. A similar argument applies to rotating and steady-state solutions. Note that $\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{0}, K*\\\\mathbf{0})=\\\\mathbf{0}$, so a trivial solution to \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} always exists.\\n\\nThere is also an important connection between the Lie algebra and the Lyapunov exponents of the system. Theorem~2.15 of \\\\citet{Aston1994} shows that for $G$-equivariant flows, the number of Lyapunov exponents equal to zero is $\\\\dim(G) - \\\\dim\\\\{g \\\\in G\\\\mid g\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\!A=A\\\\}$. In our case, the number of zero exponents equals 4 minus the number of independent continuous symmetries that leave the solution unchanged. For example, a purely translating solution has at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents because one dimension of the symmetry group (translation along the direction of motion combined with an appropriate time shift) acts trivially.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dissipativity and Existence of a Global Attractor}\\n\\nWe now prove that all trajectories remain bounded within a finite region of phase space and eventually converge to a common attractor. This property, known as dissipativity, is crucial for understanding the long-term behavior of the system and ensures that the complexity we observe is constrained within a well-defined mathematical structure.\\n\\nUsing the formal definition from \\\\cite{Robinson2001}, we show that discretized Asymptotic Lenia is a dissipative semiflow. For some $\\\\varepsilon > 0$, consider the compact set $\\\\mathcal{B}_\\\\varepsilon=[0-\\\\varepsilon,1+\\\\varepsilon]^{N^2} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$ and $M(t)=\\\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. If we choose the initial condition $A[i,j](0)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}$ and assume $0\\\\le T(\\\\cdot)\\\\le 1$, we find:\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n    \\\\frac{dM}{dt} &= T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i_M,j_M]\\\\bigr) - M \\\\le 1 - M \\\\\\\\\\n                  &\\\\implies M(t) \\\\le 1 + \\\\bigl(M(0)-1\\\\bigr)e^{-t} \\\\\\\\[8pt]\\n    \\\\frac{dm}{dt} &= T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i_m,j_m]\\\\bigr) - m \\\\ge -m \\\\\\\\\\n                  &\\\\implies m(t) \\\\ge m(0)\\\\,e^{-t}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\\\noindent where $(i_M,j_M)$ and $(i_m,j_m)$ are the indices of the maximum and minimum values of $A[i,j](t)$, respectively. Therefore, after a finite time\\n\\\\[\\n t^*= \\\\max\\\\Bigl\\\\{\\\\ln\\\\Bigl|\\\\frac{M(0)-1}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\Bigr|, \\\\ln\\\\Bigl|\\\\frac{m(0)}{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\Bigr|\\\\Bigr\\\\},\\n\\\\]\\nwe have $A[i,j](t)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}_\\\\varepsilon$ for all $t \\\\ge t^*$. We thus conclude that there exists a global attractor $\\\\mathcal{A}$. A similar argument shows that the full PDE is also dissipative, but this is not necessary for our purposes.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Helmholtz Decomposition and Behavior on the Attractor}\\n\\nWe now examine the mathematical structure of the Asymptotic Lenia dynamics to understand why it can produce complex behaviors such as chaos and periodic oscillations. Specifically, we show that the system can be decomposed into a divergence-free (rotational) part and a gradient part. This decomposition, known as the Helmholtz--Hodge decomposition, explains why Asymptotic Lenia can exhibit rich dynamics rather than simply settling into static patterns. We start by calculating the Jacobian of $\\\\mathbf{F}$ from \\\\eqref{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}:\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n    \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)}{\\\\partial A[k,l]} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial A[k,l]} \\\\bigl[T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr) - A[i,j]\\\\bigr]\\\\\\\\\\n    &= T'\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr)\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial (K*A)[i,j]}{\\\\partial A[k,l]} -  \\\\frac{\\\\partial A[i,j]}{\\\\partial A[k,l]}\\\\\\\\\\n    &= T'\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr)\\\\, K[i-k,j-l] - \\\\delta_{ik}\\\\delta_{jl}.\\n\\\\end{align*}\\nImposing $K[0,0]=0$, the divergence of the first term becomes zero, so the divergence comes entirely from summing the Kronecker delta terms, giving $\\\\nabla_A \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} = -N^2$. Hence\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = \\\\underbrace{T\\\\bigl((K*A)[i,j]\\\\bigr)}_{\\\\text{divergence-free}} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial A[i,j]} \\\\Bigl[-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{k,l} A^2[k,l]\\\\Bigr]}_{\\\\text{gradient}}.\\n\\\\]\\nSuch a decomposition is called the Helmholtz--Hodge decomposition \\\\citep{hhd2013}. We do not address uniqueness due to potential harmonic components, but we infer that $\\\\mathbf{F}$ cannot be the gradient of a scalar function. Indeed, for any pair of indices $(i,j)\\\\ne (k,l)$, the entries of the Jacobian are not equal because of the nonlinearity of $T$.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\linewidth]{figs/lyap.png}\\n    \\\\caption{Lyapunov spectra of the four classes of solutions shown in \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.

Our theory predicts that chaotic solutions should exhibit a global attractor with fractal dimension between 4 and $N^2$, with the exact value reflecting system complexity. We verify this by calculating LEs and the corresponding Kaplan--Yorke dimension for representative solutions from each class in \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.\\n\\nLEs are calculated for the spatially discretized flow using the method of \\\\citet{Benettin1980}. Specifically, we integrate a set of $k$ orthogonal vectors $\\\\mathbf{v}_i$ along the linearized flow $\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{v}}_i=\\\\nabla_A \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\, \\\\mathbf{v}_i$ and repeatedly apply QR decomposition to ensure orthogonality. \\\\citet{Benettin1980} showed that the top $k$ exponents equal the time average of the logarithmic growth of the tangent-vector norms between successive QR steps. These top $k$ LEs are then plugged into the Kaplan--Yorke formula to obtain an upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor.\\n\\nThe Lyapunov spectra for four distinct solution classes are shown in \\\\cref{fig:lyap_spectrum}. We compute these with a spatial discretization of $N=256$ and a time step of $\\\\Delta t=0.1$. After an initial transient, we run a forward pass for 100,000 steps and then a backward pass for 10,000 steps to calculate the LEs and CLVs. Because the tangent vectors $\\\\mathbf{v}_i$ are initialized randomly and take time to converge, we average only over the last 50,000 steps to obtain finite-time LEs.\\n\\nAs predicted, the purely rotating and translating solutions have three zero LEs, whereas the chaotic and periodic solutions have four. In all but the chaotic case, the top LEs are essentially zero, making $D_{KY}$ exactly equal to the number of zero LEs. When the top LEs are near zero, the $D_{KY}$ formula is sensitive to tiny differences, so in practice we set all $|\\\\lambda_i|<0.001$ to zero. For the chaotic soliton, we find a Kaplan--Yorke dimension of approximately 8.46 with two significant positive LEs.\\n\\nThe Lyapunov spectra help explain the robustness to perturbation observed in practice. Since all but a few of the $N^2$ LEs are negative (with a mean of $-1$), the system exponentially damps most modes of a random perturbation. In \\\\cref{fig:clv}, we visualize the unstable, neutral, and stable modes by plotting the covariant Lyapunov vectors for the chaotic soliton. Note that the CLVs are not necessarily orthogonal; in this case, they are not. Within the set of neutral CLVs, $\\\\lambda_4$ and $\\\\lambda_6$ are approximately identical because they correspond to the same exponent, so the CLVs span a degenerate subspace without a unique decomposition \\\\citep{Ginelli2013}.\\n\\n\\\\section{Discussion}\\n\\nIn the previous section, we verified that the number of zero LEs matches the theoretical prediction and that chaotic patterns exhibit at least one positive LE with $D_{KY}>4$. The computation of the LEs was relatively inexpensive, and the results were easy to interpret. Compared to other methods of estimating fractal dimension, this \\\\textit{Lyapunov analysis} is uniquely effective, as discussed next.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Kaplan--Yorke Dimension as a Measure of Complexity}\\nBoth box-counting and correlation dimensions are impractical for finely discretized PDEs. Box-counting requires histograms with $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\varepsilon^{-N^2})$ bins, where $\\\\varepsilon$ is the bin size. Correlation dimension requires computing pairwise distances between all sampled fields $A[i,j](n\\\\Delta t)$ on a trajectory. While feasible for moderate $N$ and trajectory lengths, convergence is slow because the method relies on sampling many points from the tail of the power-law distance distribution. Experimentally, we found that log--log plots of the pairwise distance distribution did not have a uniquely identifiable linear region, making the correlation dimension ambiguous. In contrast, the Kaplan--Yorke dimension requires only a constant number of Jacobian\u2013vector products and QR decompositions per timestep. Even for chaotic attractors, convergence to within 1\\\\% of the long-time estimate of $D_{KY}$ required only about 10,000 timesteps at $\\\\Delta t=0.1$.\\n\\nInformation dimension (upper bounded by $D_{KY}$) also offers the most intuitive interpretation: it quantifies how many real numbers are needed to describe any state on the attractor at a given resolution. For these reasons, we conclude that the Kaplan--Yorke dimension is the most practical and informative complexity measure for CCAs.\\n\\nWe therefore suggest that future work on Continuous and Neural CAs use $D_{KY}$ to quantify pattern complexity. Next, we discuss how to search systematically for higher complexity in CCAs.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Generalizing CCAs}\\n\\\\begin{table}[h]\\n\\\\centering\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\\\\linewidth}p{0.5\\\\linewidth}}\\n\\\\toprule\\n\\\\textbf{Assumption} & \\\\textbf{Resulting Prediction} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\midrule\\n$\\\\partial_t A =T(K*A)-A$,\\\\\\\\ $K$ radially symmetric & Possibility of symmetry solutions and up to four $\\\\lambda_i=0$ \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\midrule\\n$0 \\\\le T(\\\\cdot) \\\\le 1$,\\\\\\\\ $T$ Lipschitz continuous & Existence of global attractor \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\midrule\\n$K[0,0] = 0$ & $\\\\dim \\\\mathcal{A} < N^2$; not a gradient flow, possibility of dynamic attractors \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\bottomrule\\n\\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\caption{Summary of key assumptions and their mathematical implications for Asymptotic Lenia dynamics.}\\n\\\\label{tab:assumptions}\\n\\\\end{table}\\n\\nThe listed assumptions alone do not guarantee a chaotic attractor. However, at least one choice of $T$ and $K$ satisfying them does produce chaos, because Asymptotic Lenia is such an example. We also know that Asymptotic Lenia does not span the entire set of admissible CCAs. Its parameterization of $T$ and $K$ via $\\\\{\\\\mu, \\\\sigma\\\\}\\\\cup \\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\}$ is only one low-dimensional slice of the full function space.\\n\\nWe could stop here and assert that many other forms of $T$ and $K$ exhibit similar chaotic behavior. However, we aim for a broader class that could yield new phenomena such as replication, reproduction, or goal-directedness. We propose the following general formulation:\\n\\\\[\\\\partial_t A(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = f(K*A) - \\\\nabla_A G(A),\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $K$ is bounded, radially symmetric, and zero at the origin, and $f$ is Lipschitz continuous with $0 \\\\le f(\\\\cdot) \\\\le 1$. If $G$ is convex with no minimizers outside $[0,1]^{N^2}$ and $\\\\nabla_A G(\\\\mathbf{1}) \\\\ge \\\\mathbf{1}$, we guarantee both dissipativity and nonpositive divergence. This follows from a similar argument to that in the mathematical results section; we omit the proof. In this formulation, the divergence is still negative because it is the Laplacian of a convex function, but it can be non-uniform, potentially leading to highly multifractal attractors and novel complexity.\\n\\n\\\\section{Conclusion}\\n\\nWe have shown that dynamical-systems theory can be rigorously applied to Asymptotic Lenia, providing a robust toolkit for understanding complexity in CCAs. Introducing Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension allowed us to verify experimentally that a handful of key properties are sufficient for chaos. Using these properties, we proposed a generalization of CCAs that may contain new forms of complexity not captured by a single Lyapunov spectrum.\\n\\nFuture work should apply the full infinite-dimensional framework to this general CCA formulation, with the aim of explaining phenomena such as replication, reproduction, and goal-directedness. We also encourage researchers in continuous artificial life and neural cellular automata to quantify complexity using the Lyapunov analysis presented here.\\n\\n\\\\section*{Acknowledgments}\\nSupport of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), funding reference number RGPIN-2019-04669, is gratefully acknowledged.

Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical-systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan--Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.\\n\\\\end{abstract}\\n\\n% Choose one of: Full Paper, Summaries, or Late Breaking Abstracts \\nSubmission type: \\\\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\\\\\\n\\n% If sharing code / data, anonymize your repository and paste the link here.\\n% Example of anonymizing sevice for github: https://anonymous.4open.science/\\n% delete this line if not needed\\nData/Code available at: \\\\url{http://will.add.later}\\n\\n\\\\section{Background}\\\\label{sec:background}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Continuous Cellular Automata}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[ht]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\\n    \\\\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, which exist in distinct regions of the PDE's parameter space.

The \\\\textit{periodic soliton} is a translating solution which also oscillates periodically. The \\\\textit{chaotic soliton} exhibits a chaotic combination of translations, rotations, and internal oscillations.}\\n    \\\\label{fig:lenia_zoo}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nContinuous cellular automata (CCAs) were initially invented to recreate the complex emergent behavior of the program known as Conway's Game of Life \\\\citep{Gardner1970}, with the hope of finding more life-like patterns. In the search for complexity, CAs gradually evolved toward a pure (non-local) partial differential equation (PDE) formulation. ``Larger than life'' \\\\citep{Evans2001} increased the size of the kernel, SmoothLife \\\\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, Lenia \\\\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally Asymptotic Lenia \\\\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this complete transition from lookup table to PDE, analytical methods have seen very little progress, and the field has generally continued to assume that emergent complexity has no simple causal explanation.\\n\\nIn this paper, we show that transitioning to a PDE model of CCAs allows us to import well-established mathematical concepts from dynamical-systems theory. We introduce the main concepts: symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimension. Using these concepts, we establish a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure the relevant quantities to obtain a complete characterization of the complexity of solutions. Finally, we suggest a specific quantity for measuring complexity in CCAs and summarize the small set of key properties that are sufficient for a broader class of CCAs to exhibit complex behavior.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\\n\\nOur analysis centers on the Asymptotic Lenia system since it is, to date, the only CCA defined as a continuous PDE \\\\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions to the PDE are shown in \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\\\citet{alenia2021} as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\partial_t A(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\mathbf{F}(A,K*A) = T(K*A) - A, \\\\label{asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\noindent where $A \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^+ \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued 2-D scalar field, $K \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ denotes 2-D convolution, and $T \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\\\exp(-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(u-\\\\mu)^2/\\\\sigma^2)$ is parameterized by $0<\\\\sigma \\\\ll \\\\mu$ and is typically approximated via a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\\\mathbf{x})=K(\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|_2)$ comprises a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r)=(4r(r-1))^4$ with parameters $\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\}$ controlling the scaling of the rings and $R$ controlling the overall spatial scale. Importantly, $K(0)=0$ and $K$ is normalized such that $\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} K(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\,d\\\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume that the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.\\n\\nWe also define the spatially discretized version of Asymptotic Lenia, which is a finite-dimensional (ODE) approximation of the PDE and is closer to the true numerical implementation of the system. At each discrete point in space $(i,j) \\\\in [0,N-1]^2$, we define a function of time $A[i,j](t)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. The field's dynamics are given by:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} A[i,j](t) = \\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = T\\\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\\\right) - A[i,j]. \\\\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\\n\\nTo analyze Asymptotic Lenia, we seek a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of fields\u2014functions of space\u2014over time. This is the subject of infinite-dimensional dynamical-systems theory. In this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to the finite-dimensional setting because it makes our results easier to follow without loss of generality. A fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment of CCAs is beyond the scope of this paper, but we do borrow one important concept: symmetry.\\n\\nA \\\\textit{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions \\\\citep{Olver1986}. If the transformation depends on a single continuous parameter (e.g., a shift by $\\\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is called a \\\\textit{continuous symmetry}. Continuous symmetries can be organized into a \\\\textit{Lie group}. An example of a Lie group is the set of rotations and translations on a 2-D plane $SE(2)$. The associated set of infinitesimal transformations is called the \\\\textit{Lie algebra} and it is composed of the \\\\textit{generators} of the group. For example, the generator for translation in the $x$-direction is $\\\\partial_x$, and the generator for rotation is $x\\\\partial_y - y\\\\partial_x$. All 2-D CCAs are invariant under the action of the group $SE(2)$ because the update rule is identical across all of space, and the non-local component depends only on radial distance. They are also invariant under time translation since the update rule is autonomous, meaning it is independent of time.\\n\\nNow, we describe the finite-dimensional setting for dynamical-systems theory in the language of \\\\citep[e.g.,][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}. The definitions are mapped to discretized Asymptotic Lenia as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Phase Space}: $\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$\u2014the set of all possible states of the system.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Evolution Law}: $\\\\dot A(t)=\\\\mathbf{F}(A)$\u2014the system of ODEs that describes the evolution of the state over time.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Semiflow} $\\\\Phi_t(A(0))=A(t),\\\\,t\\\\ge 0$\u2014the map that takes an initial state $A(0)$ and a time $t$ to the future state $A(t)$. Its existence is guaranteed because $\\\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous and $|A|$ can never blow up in finite time \\\\citep{Robinson2001}\\\\footnote{The rigorous proof is omitted. The Lipschitz property follows from the fact that $K*A$ is bounded and $T$ is Lipschitz. $|A|$ is bounded because it can at most grow or shrink exponentially.}.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nWith the above definitions in place, we can discuss the following properties of the dynamical system.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Dissipativity}: A semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ over $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative if there exists a bounded set $\\\\mathcal{B} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every initial condition $A(0)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is absorbed into $\\\\mathcal{B}$ in finite time $t^*$.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Global Attractor}: If a semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ over $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative, then there exists a global attractor $\\\\mathcal{A}$, which is the minimal set onto which all trajectories converge as $t\\\\to\\\\infty$. The attractor entirely contains the long-term behavior of the system after transients have died away. A global attractor also guarantees at least one invariant measure on the attractor, allowing physically meaningful integrals.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Fractal Dimension}: Dissipative chaotic dynamical systems tend to settle to attractors that integrate to zero phase-space volume yet cannot be represented as an integer-dimensional manifold. These \\\\textit{fractal attractors} are characterized by their fractal dimension. Fractal dimension approximately represents the number of degrees of freedom in a given set, and there are several relevant definitions. We focus on specific cases of the generalized dimensions introduced by \\\\citet{Grassberger1983}:\\n\\\\[\\nD_q = \\\\frac{1}{1-q} \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\bigl(\\\\sum_{i} p_i^q\\\\bigr)}{\\\\log (1/\\\\varepsilon)},\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $p_i$ is the total mass in the $i$-th box in a uniform partition of phase space with resolution $\\\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\\\textit{box-counting dimension}, $D_1$ the \\\\textit{information dimension}, and $D_2$ the \\\\textit{correlation dimension}. These differ only when the density distribution on the attractor is non-uniform.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Lyapunov Exponents}: The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\}_{i=1}^n$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are defined as the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. If there is at least one positive Lyapunov exponent, the system is chaotic because nearby trajectories diverge exponentially. Several definitions exist (see \\\\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020}), but the one most suitable here is\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\lambda_i(A(0))=\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\log \\\\sigma_i(A(0),t),\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $\\\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\\\nabla_A \\\\Phi_t(A)$. These exponents can be approximated numerically using the method of \\\\citet{Benettin1980}. The corresponding covariant Lyapunov vectors, which encode the associated perturbation directions, can then be obtained with a short backward pass \\\\citep{Ginelli2007}.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Kaplan--Yorke Dimension}: The Kaplan--Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ is a heuristic upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor. Experimentally, it closely estimates $D_1$ except in rare edge cases (see \\\\citealp{Groger2013}). It is defined as\\n\\\\[\\nD_{KY}=j + \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^j \\\\lambda_i}{|\\\\lambda_{j+1}|},\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $j$ is the largest index such that the cumulative sum of the largest $j$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative.\\n\\n\\\\section{Mathematical Results}\\n\\\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\\n\\nAs explained in the Background section, \\\\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the action of the group $G=SE(2)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding Lie algebra is\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathfrak g=\\\\operatorname{span}_{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\{\\\\partial_x, \\\\partial_y, x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x, \\\\partial_t\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nUsing these symmetries, we derive conditions under which specific forms of solutions exist. We refer to these as \\\\textit{symmetry solutions}, and we express them with the ansatz $A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t \\\\gamma}A_0$, where $\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}$ and $A_0=A(\\\\mathbf{x},0)$. This ansatz becomes a solution when the following equation is satisfied:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n    \\\\partial_t\\\\bigl[e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0\\\\bigr] &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0, K * (e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0)\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma\\\\,e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0                &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0, e^{t \\\\gamma}(K*A_0)\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    e^{t \\\\gamma}\\\\,\\\\gamma A_0                &= e^{t \\\\gamma}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(A_0, K*A_0\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma A_0                              &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(A_0, K*A_0\\\\bigr). \\\\label{stationary_cond}\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\nFrom the second to third line we use the $G$-equivariance property of $\\\\mathbf{F}$.

Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical-systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $>4$, (3) identification of Kaplan--Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.\\n\\\\end{abstract}\\n\\n% Choose one of: Full Paper, Summaries, or Late Breaking Abstracts \\nSubmission type: \\\\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\\\\\\n\\n% If sharing code / data, anonymize your repository and paste the link here.\\n% Example of anonymizing sevice for github: https://anonymous.4open.science/\\n% delete this line if not needed\\nData/Code available at: \\\\url{http://will.add.later}\\n\\n\\\\section{Background}\\\\label{sec:background}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Continuous Cellular Automata}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[ht]\\n    \\\\centering\\n    \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\\n    \\\\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, which exist in distinct regions of the PDE's parameter space.

The \\\\textit{chaotic soliton} exhibits a chaotic combination of translations, rotations, and internal oscillations.}\\n    \\\\label{fig:lenia_zoo}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nContinuous cellular automata (CCAs) were initially invented to recreate the complex emergent behavior of the program known as Conway's Game of Life \\\\citep{Gardner1970}, with the hope of finding more life-like patterns. In the search for complexity, CAs gradually evolved toward a pure (non-local) partial differential equation (PDE) formulation. ``Larger than life'' \\\\citep{Evans2001} increased the size of the kernel, SmoothLife \\\\citep{Rafler2011} introduced continuous states, Lenia \\\\citep{Chan2019} introduced continuous time and space, and finally Asymptotic Lenia \\\\citep{alenia2021} removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this complete transition from lookup table to PDE, analytical methods have seen very little progress, and the field has generally continued to assume that emergent complexity has no simple causal explanation.\\n\\nIn this paper, we show that transitioning to a PDE model of CCAs allows us to import well-established mathematical concepts from dynamical-systems theory. We introduce the main concepts: symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimension. Using these concepts, we establish a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure the relevant quantities to obtain a complete characterization of the complexity of solutions. Finally, we suggest a specific quantity for measuring complexity in CCAs and summarize the small set of key properties that are sufficient for a broader class of CCAs to exhibit complex behavior.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\\n\\nOur analysis centers on the Asymptotic Lenia system since it is, to date, the only CCA defined as a continuous PDE \\\\citep{Davis2022,Kojima2023}. The main classes of dynamic solutions to the PDE are shown in \\\\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\\\citet{alenia2021} as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\partial_t A(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\mathbf{F}(A,K*A) = T(K*A) - A, \\\\label{asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\noindent where $A \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^+ \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued 2-D scalar field, $K \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ denotes 2-D convolution, and $T \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\\\exp(-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(u-\\\\mu)^2/\\\\sigma^2)$ is parameterized by $0<\\\\sigma \\\\ll \\\\mu$ and is typically approximated via a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\\\mathbf{x})=K(\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|_2)$ comprises a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r)=(4r(r-1))^4$ with parameters $\\\\{\\\\beta_i\\\\}$ controlling the scaling of the rings and $R$ controlling the overall spatial scale. Importantly, $K(0)=0$ and $K$ is normalized such that $\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} K(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\,d\\\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume that the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.\\n\\nWe also define the spatially discretized version of Asymptotic Lenia, which is a finite-dimensional (ODE) approximation of the PDE and is closer to the true numerical implementation of the system. At each discrete point in space $(i,j) \\\\in [0,N-1]^2$, we define a function of time $A[i,j](t)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}$. The field's dynamics are given by:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\frac{d}{dt} A[i,j](t) = \\\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = T\\\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\\\right) - A[i,j]. \\\\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\\n\\nTo analyze Asymptotic Lenia, we seek a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of fields\u2014functions of space\u2014over time. This is the subject of infinite-dimensional dynamical-systems theory. In this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to the finite-dimensional setting because it makes our results easier to follow without loss of generality. A fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment of CCAs is beyond the scope of this paper, but we do borrow one important concept: symmetry.\\n\\nA \\\\textit{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions \\\\citep{Olver1986}. If the transformation depends on a single continuous parameter (e.g., a shift by $\\\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is called a \\\\textit{continuous symmetry}. Continuous symmetries can be organized into a \\\\textit{Lie group}. An example of a Lie group is the set of rotations and translations on a 2-D plane $SE(2)$. The associated set of infinitesimal transformations is called the \\\\textit{Lie algebra} and it is composed of the \\\\textit{generators} of the group. For example, the generator for translation in the $x$-direction is $\\\\partial_x$, and the generator for rotation is $x\\\\partial_y - y\\\\partial_x$. All 2-D CCAs are invariant under the action of the group $SE(2)$ because the update rule is identical across all of space, and the non-local component depends only on radial distance. They are also invariant under time translation since the update rule is autonomous, meaning it is independent of time.\\n\\nNow, we describe the finite-dimensional setting for dynamical-systems theory in the language of \\\\citep[e.g.,][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}. The definitions are mapped to discretized Asymptotic Lenia as follows:\\n\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Phase Space}: $\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$\u2014the set of all possible states of the system.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Evolution Law}: $\\\\dot A(t)=\\\\mathbf{F}(A)$\u2014the system of ODEs that describes the evolution of the state over time.\\n    \\\\item \\\\textit{Semiflow} $\\\\Phi_t(A(0))=A(t),\\\\,t\\\\ge 0$\u2014the map that takes an initial state $A(0)$ and a time $t$ to the future state $A(t)$. Its existence is guaranteed because $\\\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous and $|A|$ can never blow up in finite time \\\\citep{Robinson2001}\\\\footnote{The rigorous proof is omitted. The Lipschitz property follows from the fact that $K*A$ is bounded and $T$ is Lipschitz. $|A|$ is bounded because it can at most grow or shrink exponentially.}.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nWith the above definitions in place, we can discuss the following properties of the dynamical system.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Dissipativity}: A semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ over $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative if there exists a bounded set $\\\\mathcal{B} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every initial condition $A(0)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is absorbed into $\\\\mathcal{B}$ in finite time $t^*$.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Global Attractor}: If a semiflow $\\\\Phi_t$ over $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative, then there exists a global attractor $\\\\mathcal{A}$, which is the minimal set onto which all trajectories converge as $t\\\\to\\\\infty$. The attractor entirely contains the long-term behavior of the system after transients have died away. A global attractor also guarantees at least one invariant measure on the attractor, allowing physically meaningful integrals.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Fractal Dimension}: Dissipative chaotic dynamical systems tend to settle to attractors that integrate to zero phase-space volume yet cannot be represented as an integer-dimensional manifold. These \\\\textit{fractal attractors} are characterized by their fractal dimension. Fractal dimension approximately represents the number of degrees of freedom in a given set, and there are several relevant definitions. We focus on specific cases of the generalized dimensions introduced by \\\\citet{Grassberger1983}:\\n\\\\[\\nD_q = \\\\frac{1}{1-q} \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\bigl(\\\\sum_{i} p_i^q\\\\bigr)}{\\\\log (1/\\\\varepsilon)},\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $p_i$ is the total mass in the $i$-th box in a uniform partition of phase space with resolution $\\\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\\\textit{box-counting dimension}, $D_1$ the \\\\textit{information dimension}, and $D_2$ the \\\\textit{correlation dimension}. These differ only when the density distribution on the attractor is non-uniform.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Lyapunov Exponents}: The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) $\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\}_{i=1}^n$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are defined as the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. If there is at least one positive Lyapunov exponent, the system is chaotic because nearby trajectories diverge exponentially. Several definitions exist (see \\\\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020}), but the one most suitable here is\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\lambda_i(A(0))=\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\log \\\\sigma_i(A(0),t),\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $\\\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\\\nabla_A \\\\Phi_t(A)$. These exponents can be approximated numerically using the method of \\\\citet{Benettin1980}. The corresponding covariant Lyapunov vectors, which encode the associated perturbation directions, can then be obtained with a short backward pass \\\\citep{Ginelli2007}.\\n\\n\\\\textit{Kaplan--Yorke Dimension}: The Kaplan--Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ is a heuristic upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor. Experimentally, it closely estimates $D_1$ except in rare edge cases (see \\\\citealp{Groger2013}). It is defined as\\n\\\\[\\nD_{KY}=j + \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^j \\\\lambda_i}{|\\\\lambda_{j+1}|},\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\noindent where $j$ is the largest index such that the cumulative sum of the largest $j$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative.\\n\\n\\\\section{Mathematical Results}\\n\\\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\\n\\nAs explained in the Background section, \\\\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the action of the group $G=SE(2)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding Lie algebra is\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathfrak g=\\\\operatorname{span}_{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\{\\\\partial_x, \\\\partial_y, x\\\\partial_y-y\\\\partial_x, \\\\partial_t\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nUsing these symmetries, we derive conditions under which specific forms of solutions exist. We refer to these as \\\\textit{symmetry solutions}, and we express them with the ansatz $A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t \\\\gamma}A_0$, where $\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}$ and $A_0=A(\\\\mathbf{x},0)$. This ansatz becomes a solution when the following equation is satisfied:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n    \\\\partial_t\\\\bigl[e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0\\\\bigr] &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0, K * (e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0)\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma\\\\,e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0                &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(e^{t \\\\gamma} A_0, e^{t \\\\gamma}(K*A_0)\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    e^{t \\\\gamma}\\\\,\\\\gamma A_0                &= e^{t \\\\gamma}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(A_0, K*A_0\\\\bigr) \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\gamma A_0                              &= \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\bigl(A_0, K*A_0\\\\bigr). \\\\label{stationary_cond}\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\nFrom the second to third line we use the $G$-equivariance property of $\\\\mathbf{F}$. We also use the fact that $e^{t\\\\gamma}$ commutes with $\\\\gamma$ and $K$ and has an inverse operator $e^{-t\\\\gamma}$. These facts are nontrivial and follow directly from the specific form of the PDE.\\n\\nA key result of \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} is that no evolution is required to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution $A(\\\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{v}t,0)=e^{t \\\\gamma}A_0$ with $\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2$, we need only find an initial field $A_0$ such that \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} is satisfied with $\\\\gamma=-\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\partial_x\\\\,\\\\, \\\\partial_y\\\\end{bmatrix}^\\\\top$. A similar argument applies to rotating and steady-state solutions. Note that $\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{0}, K*\\\\mathbf{0})=\\\\mathbf{0}$, so a trivial solution to \\\\eqref{stationary_cond} always exists.\\n\\nThere is also an important connection between the Lie algebra and the Lyapunov exponents of the system. Theorem~2.15 of \\\\citet{Aston1994} shows that for $G$-equivariant flows, the number of Lyapunov exponents equal to zero is $\\\\dim(G) - \\\\dim\\\\{g \\\\in G\\\\mid g\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\!A=A\\\\}$. In our case, the number of zero exponents equals 4 minus the number of independent continuous symmetries that leave the solution unchanged. For example, a purely translating solution has at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents because one dimension of the symmetry group (translation along the direction of motion combined with an appropriate time shift) acts trivially.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Dissipativity and Existence of a Global Attractor}\\n\\nWe now prove that all trajectories remain bounded within a finite region of phase space and eventually converge to a common attractor.

There are uncertainties about the continuity and Lipschitz conditions that must be clarified, but the general idea holds strong."

The second argument of $F$ is adjusted to account for the commuting property between $e^{t\\gamma}$ and the convolution operator $K*$. Since $K$ is translation-equivariant or radial, the transformation commutes with the convolution, letting us factor out $e^{t\\gamma}$. From line 2 to line 3, equivariance of $F$ is used.

If \\( K \\) is radial and isotropic, it should commute with translations and rotations. The operator \\( e^{t\\gamma} \\) acts through a linear combination of translated, rotated, or time-shifted variables, so the convolution operator only affects spatial variables and remains independent of time."
