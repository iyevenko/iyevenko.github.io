In the search for complexity, CAs gradually evolved towards a pure (non-local) partial differential equation (PDE) formulation. Larger-than-life increased the size of the kernel, Primordia introduced a range of states, SmoothLife introduced continuous states, Lenia introduced continuous time and space, and finally Asymptotic Lenia removed the discontinuous update rule. Despite this total transition from lookup table to PDE, the methods for analyzing these systems have seen very little progress. As a result, the field has largely retained the intuition that emergent complexity has no simple causal explanation.\n\nIn this paper, we show that transitioning to a PDE model of CCAs allows us to import well-established mathematical concepts from dynamical systems theory. We first introduce the main concepts: symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimension, and more. Using these concepts, we establish a mathematical explanation for the observed complexity in Asymptotic Lenia. We then measure the relevant quantities to obtain a complete characterization of the complexity of solutions. Finally, we suggest a specific quantity for measuring complexity in CCAs and summarize the small set of key properties which are sufficient for a broader class of CCAs to exhibit complex behavior.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n% Choose one of: Full Paper, Summaries, or Late Breaking Abstracts \nSubmission type: \\textbf{Full Paper}\\\\\n\n% If sharing code / data, anonymize your repository and paste the link here.\n% Example of anonymizing sevice for github: https://anonymous.4open.science/\n% delete this line if not needed\nData/Code available at: \\url{http://your.repo.here.com}\n\n\\section{Background}\\label{sec:background}\n\n\\subsection{Asymptotic Lenia}\n\nOur analysis centers around the Asymptotic Lenia system since it is the only CCA discovered thus far that is defined as a continuous PDE. The main classes of dynamic solutions to the PDE are shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}. The PDE is defined by \\citet{alenia2021} as follows:\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/zoo.png}\n    \\caption{Four classes of dynamic solutions to Asymptotic Lenia, which exist in distinct regions of the PDE's parameter space. The \\textit{soliton} is a stable, purely translating solution. The \\textit{rotator} is a stable, purely rotating solution. The \\textit{periodic soliton} is a translating solution which also oscillates periodically. The \\textit{chaotic soliton} exhibits a chaotic combination of translations, rotations, and internal oscillations.}\n    \\label{fig:lenia_zoo}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\mathbf{F}(A,K*A) = T(K*A) - A \\label{asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhere $A: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued 2-D scalar field, $K: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a radially symmetric kernel, $(*)$ is the 2-D convolution operator, and $T: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the growth function, applied pointwise. The Gaussian growth function $T(u)=\\exp(-\\tfrac{1}{2}(u-\\mu)^2/\\sigma^2)$ is parameterized by $0<\\sigma \\ll \\mu$, and is typically approximated via a polynomial or step function for computational efficiency. The kernel $K(\\mathbf{x})=K(\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2)$ is composed of a sum of uniformly spaced concentric rings of the form $K_C(r)=(4r(r-1))^4$ with parameters $\\{\\beta_i\\}$ controlling the scaling of the rings, and $R$ controlling the overall spatial scale. Importantly, $K(0)=0$ and $K$ is normalized such that $\\int_{\\Omega} K(\\mathbf{x})\\,d\\mathbf{x}=1$. We assume that the PDE is solved on a bounded domain $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe also define the spatially-discretized version of Asymptotic Lenia, which is a finite-dimensional (ODE) approximation of the PDE, and is closer to the true implementation of the system on a computer. At each discrete point in space $(i,j) \\in [0,N-1]^2$, we define a function of time $A[i,j](t)\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The field's dynamics are given by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{d}{dt} A[i,j](t) = \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right) - A[i,j] \\label{discrete_asymptotic_lenia}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Dynamical Systems}\n\nTo analyze Asymptotic Lenia, we seek a theoretical framework that describes the evolution of fields---functions of space---over time. This is the subject of the theory of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. In this paper, however, we restrict our analysis to the finite-dimensional setting because it makes our results easier to follow, without loss of generality. A fully rigorous infinite-dimensional treatment of CCAs is beyond the scope of this paper, but we do borrow one important concept: symmetry.\n\nA \\textit{symmetry group} of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions \\citep{Olver1986}. If the transformation depends on a single continuous parameter (e.g. a shift by $\\delta$ in the $x$-direction), the symmetry is called a \\textit{continuous symmetry}. Continuous symmetries can be organized into a \\textit{Lie group}. An example of a Lie group is the set of rotations and translations on a 2-D plane $SE(2)$. The associated set of infinitesimal transformations is called the \\textit{Lie algebra} and it is composed of the \\textit{generators} of the group. For example, the generators for translation in the $x$-direction is $\\partial_x$ and the generator for rotation is $x\\partial_y - y\\partial_x$. All 2-D CCAs are invariant under the action of the group $SE(2)$ because the update rule is identical across all of space, and the non-local component is only a function of radial distance. They are also invariant under time translation since the update rule is autonomous, meaning it is independent of time.\n\nNow, we describe the finite-dimensional setting for dynamical systems theory in the language of \\citep[e.g.,][]{Temam1997,Hale1988,Robinson2001,Sell2002}. The definitions are mapped to discretized Asymptotic Lenia as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textit{Phase Space}: $\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^{N^2}$: The set of all possible states of the system. \n    \\item \\textit{Evolution Law}: $\\dot A(t)=\\mathbf{F}(A)$: The system of ODEs that describes the evolution of the state over time.\n    \\item \\textit{Semiflow} $\\Phi_t(A(0))=A(t),t\\ge 0$: The map that takes an initial state $A(0)$ and a time $t$ to the future state $A(t)$. Its existence is guaranteed because $\\mathbf{F}$ is Lipschitz continuous and $|A|$ can never blow up in finite time \\citep{Robinson2001}\\footnote{The rigorous proof is omitted. The Lipschitz property follows from that fact that $K*A$ is bounded and $T$ is Lipschitz. $|A|$ is bounded because it can at most grow/shrink exponentially.}. $\\Phi_t$ is also often called the semigroup, or fundamental matrix.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWith the above definitions in place, we can discuss the following properties of the dynamical system.\n\n\\textit{Dissipativity}: A semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative if there exists a bounded set $\\mathcal{B} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every initial condition $A(0)\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is absorbed into $\\mathcal{B}$ in a finite time $t^*$.\n\n\\textit{Global Attractor}: If a semiflow $\\Phi_t$ over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is dissipative, then there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ which is the minimal set onto which all trajectories converge as $t\\to\\infty$. A global attractor also guarantees at least one invariant measure on the attractor, letting us take physically meaningful integrals over the attractor.\n\n\\textit{Fractal Dimension}: Dissipative chaotic dynamical systems tend to settle to attractors which integrate to zero phase space volume but cannot be represented as an integer-dimensional manifold. These are called fractal attractors, and they are characterized by their fractal dimension. Fractal dimension approximately represents the number of degrees of freedom in a given set, and there are several relevant definitions for fractal dimension. We focus on specific cases of R\u00e9nyi entropy, defined as\n\n\\[\nD_\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\frac{\\log \\sum_{i} p_i^\\alpha}{\\log \\varepsilon}\n\\]\n\nwhere $p_i$ is the total probability of the $i$-th box in a uniform partition of phase space with some resolution $\\varepsilon$. $D_0$ is the \\textit{box-counting dimension}, $D_1$ is the \\textit{information dimension}, and $D_2$ is the \\textit{correlation dimension}. These only differ when the distribution of density on the attractor is non-uniform.\n\n\\textit{Lyapunov Exponents}: The Lyapunov exponents $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ of a trajectory $A(t)$ are defined as the average exponential growth rates of perturbations to $A(0)$. There exist several definitions (see \\citet[Sec.~6.3.1]{Kuznetsov2020} for a comprehensive overview), but the one which applies best to our setting is: \n\\[\n\\lambda_i(A(0))=\\limsup_{t\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\log \\sigma_i(A(0),t)\n\\]\nwhere $\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of the Jacobian $\\nabla_A \\Phi_t(A)$. These exponents can be approximated numerically using the method presented by \\citet{Benettin1980}. Furthermore, the covariant Lyapunov vectors, which encode the associated perturbation directions for each exponent, can be calculated easily with a short backwards pass after applying Benettin's method \\citep{Ginelli2007}.\n\n\\textit{Kaplan-Yorke Dimension}: The Kaplan-Yorke dimension $D_{KY}$ is a heuristic upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor. Experimentally, it has been shown to closely estimate $D_1$, except in rare edge cases (see discussion in \\citep{Groger2013}). It is defined as\n\\[\nD_{KY}=j + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^j \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{j+1}|}\n\\]\nwhere $j$ is the largest index such that the cumulative sum of the largest $j$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative.\n\n\\section{Mathematical Results}\n\\subsection{Existence of Symmetry Solutions}\n\nAs explained in the Background section, \\eqref{asymptotic_lenia} is invariant under the action of the group $G=SE(2)\\times\\mathbb{R}$ with the associated Lie algebra:\n\\[\n\\mathfrak g=\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb R}\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y, x\\partial_y-y\\partial_x, \\partial_t\\}\n\\]\nUsing these symmetries, we can show that the ansatz $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0,\\, \\gamma \\in \\mathfrak{g}, A_0=A(\\mathbf{x},0)$ is a solution provided the following equation is satisfied:\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\partial_t\\left[e^{t \\gamma} A_0\\right] &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, K * (e^{t \\gamma} A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma\\,e^{t \\gamma} A_0                &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(e^{t \\gamma} A_0, e^{t \\gamma}(K*A_0)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\gamma A_0                &= e^{t \\gamma}\\,\\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    \\gamma A_0                              &= \\mathbf{F}\\left(A_0, K*A_0\\right) \\label{stationary_cond}\n\\end{align}\n\nCrucially, this means that no evolution is required to verify a symmetry solution. For example, to find a translating solution $A(\\mathbf{x},t)=A(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{v}t,0)=e^{t \\gamma}A_0,\\,\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we need only find an initial field $A_0$ such that \\eqref{stationary_cond} is satisfied with $\\gamma=-\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}\\partial_x\\,\\, \\partial_y\\end{bmatrix}^\\top$. A similar argument applies to rotating solutions and steady state solutions. Note that since $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{0}, K*\\mathbf{0})=\\mathbf{0}$, a trivial solution to \\eqref{stationary_cond} always exists. \n\nThere is also an important connection between the Lie algebra and the Lyapunov exponents of the system. Theorem 2.15 of \\citet{Aston1994} showed that for $G$-equivariant flows, the number of Lyapunov exponents equal to zero is $\\dim\\{G\\} - \\dim\\{g \\in G\\,|\\,g\\!\\cdot\\!A=A\\}$. In our case, the number of zero exponents equals 4 minus the number of independent continuous symmetries that leave the solution unchanged. For example, a purely translating solution will have at most $4-1=3$ zero exponents because shifting in space and then back in time proportional to the velocity does nothing. \n\n\\subsection{Dissipativity and Existence of a Global Attractor}\nUsing the formal definition from \\cite{Robinson2001}, we can show that discretized Asymptotic Lenia is a dissipative semiflow.  For some $\\varepsilon > 0$, consider the compact set $\\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon=[0-\\varepsilon,1+\\varepsilon]^{N^2} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$. Let $m(t)=\\min_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$, $M(t)=\\max_{i,j}A[i,j](t)$. If we choose the initial condition $A[i,j](0)\\in \\mathcal{X}$ and assume $0\\le T(\\cdot)\\le 1$, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{dM}{dt} &= T(K*A) - M \\le 1 - M \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies M(t) \\le 1 + \\bigl(M(0)-1\\bigr)e^{-t} \\\\[8pt]\n    \\frac{dm}{dt} &= T(K*A) - m \\ge -m \\\\[4pt]\n                  &\\implies m(t) \\ge m(0)\\,e^{-t}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\noindent Therefore, after a finite time\n\n\\[\nt^*= \\max\\left\\{\\ln\\left|\\frac{M(0)-1}{\\varepsilon}\\right|, \\ln\\left|\\frac{m(0)}{\\varepsilon}\\right|\\right\\}\n\\]\nwe must have $A[i,j](t)\\in \\mathcal{B}_\\varepsilon,\\, \\forall\\, t \\ge t^*$. We can conclude that there exists a global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$. A very similar argument can be used to show that the full PDE is also dissipative, but this is not necessary for our purposes. We can now inquire about the kinds of behavior we expect to see on the attractor. \n\n\\subsection{Helmholtz Decomposition and Behavior on the Attractor}\nWe can calculate the Jacobian of $\\mathbf{F}$ from \\eqref{discrete_asymptotic_lenia} as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}[i,j](A)}{\\partial A[k,l]} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[k,l]} \\left[T((K*A)[i,j]) - A\\right]\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, \\frac{\\partial (K*A)[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]} -  \\frac{\\partial A[i,j]}{\\partial A[k,l]}\\\\\n    &= T'((K*A)[i,j])\\, K[i-k,j-l] - \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}\n\\end{align*}\n\nUsing the fact that $K[0,0]$, the divergence of the first term becomes zero so the divergence comes entirely from summing the kronecker delta terms, giving $\\nabla_A \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = -N^2$. This means that we can write the $\\mathbf{F}$ as the sum of a divergence-free term and a term which is the gradient of a scalar potential [find citation]:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}[i,j](A) = \\underbrace{T\\left((K*A)[i,j]\\right)}_{\\text{divergence-free}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A[i,j]} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k,l} A^2[k,l]\\right]}_{\\text{gradient}}\n\\]\n\nSuch a decomposition is known as a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition \\citep{hhd2013}. We do not comment on the uniqueness of the decomposition due to the possibility for harmonic components, but we can infer that $\\mathbf{F}$ cannot be the gradient of a scalar function. This is because for any arbitrary pair of indices $(i,j)\\ne (k,l)$, the entries of the Jacobian are not necessarily equal due to nonlinearity of $T$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/lyap.png}\n    \\caption{Lyapunov Spectra of the four classes of solutions shown in \\cref{fig:lenia_zoo}.

The Kaplan-Yorke dimension is calculated based on the values of these exponents and shown in the titles.}\n    \\label{fig:lyap_spectrum}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe stress that this result is crucial for the existence of chaotic or periodic dynamics on attractors. While trajectories of a pure gradient flow are not guaranteed to reach a steady state, they are guaranteed to enter and remain in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the set of steady states \\citep{Hale1988,Robinson2001}. The classic \"neighbor-sum\" rule turns out to be exactly the right kind of term to allow for complex behavior.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/clv.png}\n    \\caption{Covariant Lyapunov vectors of the chaotic soliton.

The top 10 CLVs are visualized on the right, where blue and red correspond to negative and positive values respectively.}\n    \\label{fig:clv}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Experimental Results}\nIn the previous section, we showed that there must exist a global attractor which has fractal dimension between $4$ and $N^2$, provided that the solution to the ODE has no trivial symmetries. In practice, we observe persistent, dynamic solutions which apparently exhibit no such symmetries. Motivated by this, we empirically calculate the Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and corresponding Kaplan-Yorke dimension of several distinct attractors in Asymptotic Lenia. LEs are calculated for the spatially-discretized flow using the method first proposed by \\citet{Benettin1980}. In particular, we integrate a set of $k$ orthogonal vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ along the linearized flow $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_i=\\nabla_A \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{v}_i$ and repeatedly apply QR decomposition to ensure orthogonality. \\citet{Benettin1980} showed that the top $k$ exponents equal the time average of the logarithmic growth of the tangent vectors' norms between successive applications of QR decomposition. These top $k$ LEs can then be plugged into the Kaplan-Yorke formula to obtain an upper bound on the information dimension of the attractor.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra for four distinct solution classes are shown in \\cref{fig:lyap_spectrum}. We calculate these with a spatial discretization of $N=256$ and a time step of $\\Delta t=0.1$. After an initial transient period, we run a forward pass for 100000 steps and then a backwards pass for 10000 steps to calculate the LEs and CLVs. Since the tangent vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ are initialized randomly and take time to converge, we only average of the last 50000 steps to obtain the finite-time LEs.\n\nAs predicted, the purely rotating and translating solutions have 3 zero LEs, while the chaotic and periodic solutions have 4 zero LEs. Intuitively, in all but the chaotic case, the top LEs are all zero, making $D_{KY}$ exactly equal to the number of zero LEs. When the top LEs are all close to zero, the $D_{KY}$ formula is sensitive to tiny differences in the values, so in practice we round all $|\\lambda_i|<0.001$ to zero. It is impractical to wait for these values to converge to machine zero because convergence time is inversely proportional to magnitude.\n\nThe Lyapunov spectra help explain the remarkable robustness to perturbation we observe in practice. Since all but a few of the $N^2$ LEs are negative (with an average value of -1), the system exponentially decays most modes of a random perturbation. In \\cref{fig:clv}, we visualize the unstable, neutral, and stable modes by calculating the covariant Lypaunov vectors (CLVs) for the chaotic soliton. It is important to note that the CLVs are not necessarily orthogonal, and in this case they certainly are not. We also observe that within the set of neutral CLVs, $\\lambda_4$ and $\\lambda_6$ are approximately identical. This is because they theoretically correspond to the same exponent so the CLVs span a degenerate subspace that has no unique decomposition \\citep{Ginelli2013}.\n\n\n% Symmetry analysis, Helmholtz decomposition, conditions on kernel for constant negative divergence, symmetries corresponding to zero lyapunov exponents.\n\n% Experimental Analysis of Asymptotic Lenia\n% Correlation dimension, information dimension (Kaplan-Yorke dimension), eigenvector decomposition, stability analysis\n\n% Discussion\n% Define general class of K(0)=0 CCA's, discuss # of attractors, connect to Lorenz system, Reaction Diffusion, CGLE, future work\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nIn the previous section, we verified that the number of zero LEs matched the theoretically predicted quantity and that chaotic patterns indeed exhibit at least one positive LE and $D_{KY}>4$. The calculation of the LEs was relatively computationally inexpensive and the results were easy to interpret. Compared to other methods of estimating fractal dimension, this ``Lyapunov analysis'' is uniquely effective for reasons we will discuss next.\n\n\\subsection{KY Dimension as a Measure of Complexity}\nBoth the box-counting dimension and correlation dimension are impractical measures of fractal dimension for finely discretized PDEs. Box-counting dimension requires constructing histograms with $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-N^2})$ bins, where $\\varepsilon$ is the bin size. Correlation dimension requires calculating the pairwise distance between all sampled fields $A[i,j](n\\Delta t)$ on a trajectory, which is expensive but tractable for moderate $N$ and trajectory lengths. However, convergence is slow because the method relies on sampling many points from the tail of the power-law distance distribution. Experimentally, we also found that log-log plots of the pairwise distance distribution did not have a uniquely identifiable linear region, making the correlation dimension difficult to interpret unambiguously. On the other hand, the Kaplan-Yorke dimension requires just a constant number of Jacobian-vector product operations and QR decompositions to be carried out at each timestep of the state evolution. Even for chaotic attractors, we found in our experiments that convergence to within $1\\%$ of the long-time estimate of $D_{KY}$ required only $\\sim 10^4$ timesteps at $\\Delta t=0.1$. \n\nAdditionally, information dimension (upper bounded by $D_{KY}$) offers the most intuitive interpretation of fractal dimension. It tells us how many bits of information are needed to describe any state on the attractor for a given resolution. Equivalently, we can think of information dimension as answering \\textit{how many real numbers are needed to encode the state} as opposed to how many binary numbers---i.e. entropy. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is the most practical and informative measure of complexity for Continuous Cellular Automata. We suggest that future works on Continuous and Neural CAs quantify the complexity of patterns they discover via $D_{KY}$. Next, we discuss how we can systematically search for higher complexity in CCAs.\n\n\\subsection{Generalizing CCAs}\nWe begin by summarizing the mathematical predictions, and the minimal assumptions from which we derived them.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\\linewidth}p{0.5\\linewidth}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Assumption} & \\textbf{Resulting Prediction} \\\\\n\\midrule\n$\\partial_t A =T(K*A)-A$,\\newline $K$ radially symmetric. & Possibility of symmetry solutions and up to four $\\lambda_i=0$. \\\\\n\\midrule\n$0 \\le T(\\cdot) \\le 1$,\\newline $T$ Lipschitz continuous & Existence of global attractor. \\\\ \n\\midrule\n$K[0,0] = 0$ & $\\dim \\mathcal{A} < N^2$.

The parameterization of $T$ and $K$ via the parameter set $\\{\\mu, \\sigma\\}\\cup \\{\\beta_i\\}$ is just one low-dimensional parameterization of the space of functions satisfying the above assumptions. We could stop there, and suggest that there are many other forms of $T$ and $K$ which exhibit similar kinds of chaotic behavior. However, we aim to find a broader class of CCAs which might exhibit new types of complex behavior like replication, reproduction, or organization. We suggest that the following general formulation of CCAs be explored in future work:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\partial_t A(\\mathbf{x},t) = f(K*A) - \\nabla_A G(A)\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhere $K$ is radially symmetric and zero at the origin, and $f$ is a Lipschitz continuous nonlinear function such that $0 \\le f(\\cdot) \\le 1$. If we require $G$ be a convex function with no minimizers outside $[0,1]^{N^2}$ and $\\nabla_A G(\\mathbf{1}) \\ge \\mathbf{1}$, we can guarantee both dissipativity and nonpositive divergence. This follows from a similar argument to the one made in the (mathematical results) section. In this formulation, the divergence is still negative since it is the laplacian of a convex function, but it will also be nonuniform over the phase space. We suspect that nonuniform divergence may be enough for highly multifractal attractors to emerge, leading to qualitatively different forms of complexity.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\n\n\n\\footnotesize\n\\bibliographystyle{apalike}\n\\bibliography{main}\n\n\\end{document}"

By exploiting the $SE(2)\\!\\times\\!\\mathbb{R}$ symmetry of the governing equation, we proved the existence of canonical symmetry solutions and related the dimension of their neutral subspace to the number of zero Lyapunov exponents.  Establishing dissipativity for the spatially discretised system guaranteed a compact global attractor, while a Helmholtz\u2013Hodge decomposition showed that the flow is not purely gradient, thereby permitting non-trivial recurrent dynamics.\n\nNumerical experiments corroborated the theoretical results.  For representative translating, rotating, periodic and chaotic patterns we computed full Lyapunov spectra, covariant Lyapunov vectors and Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimensions.  The spectra confirmed the predicted multiplicity of zero exponents and revealed a positive exponent for chaotic solitons, implying sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  Moreover, the Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension provided a fast, interpretable proxy for attractor complexity, outperforming traditional box-counting or correlation-dimension estimates both in computational cost and convergence behaviour.\n\nOur analysis isolates three minimal structural conditions\u2014radial convolution with $K(0)=0$, a Lipschitz growth function bounded in $[0,1]$, and linear dissipation\u2014that together suffice for high-dimensional chaotic attractors of intermediate fractal dimension to arise.  These conditions define a broad design space for future continuous or neural CAs, within which complexity can be quantified economically via Lyapunov analysis.  Promising directions include: (i) varying the kernel and growth function beyond the classical Gaussian\u2013ring family to induce multifractal attractors; (ii) introducing additional conserved quantities or weakly broken symmetries to explore self-replication and long-range organisation; and (iii) extending the present finite-dimensional proofs to the full infinite-dimensional PDE, tightening the link between numerical observations and analytical guarantees.\n\nBy bridging cellular automata, nonlinear dynamics and information theory, this work provides a compact toolkit for discovering, characterising and comparing emergent behaviours in continuous media.  We hope it will facilitate systematic searches for richer forms of artificial life and deepen our understanding of complexity in spatially extended systems.\n```"

Classical Greek City-States (e.g., Athens, Sparta)**\n- **Period**: 5th\u20134th century BCE\n- **Fall**: Gradual loss of autonomy, ending with Macedonian domination\n\n**Reasons for decline**:\n- **Internecine warfare**: The Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BCE) between Athens and Sparta weakened all Greek city-states.\n- **Macedonian conquest**: Philip II of Macedon capitalized on this disunity, defeating the city-states at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BCE.\n- **Lack of unity**: The fiercely independent poleis (city-states) were rarely able to sustain alliances or federal systems.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Macedonian Empire (Alexander the Great)**\n- **Period**: 336\u2013323 BCE\n- **Fall**: Fragmentation after Alexander\u2019s death\n\n**Reasons for collapse**:\n- **No clear succession**: Alexander died in 323 BCE without a strong heir.\n- **Wars of the Diadochi**: His generals fought over territory, dividing the empire into Hellenistic kingdoms (e.g., Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Asia).\n- **Overextension**: The empire stretched from Greece to India and was too vast to govern centrally.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire)**\n- **Period**: 330\u20131453 CE\n- **Fall**: Captured by the Ottoman Turks\n\n**Reasons for decline**:\n- **Internal instability**: Court intrigue, civil wars, and religious disputes (e.g., Iconoclasm) weakened the state.\n- **Economic strain**: Constant warfare, especially defending against Persians, Arabs, and later Turks, drained resources.\n- **Fourth Crusade (1204)**: Latin Crusaders sacked Constantinople, severely weakening the empire.\n- **Rise of the Ottomans**: The Ottomans systematically conquered Byzantine territories, culminating in the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a timeline or map showing this progression?"

              "Constantine\u2019s conversion to Christianity is one of the most pivotal events in Roman history, but its motivations remain debated. The reasons behind his conversion were likely a mix of **political pragmatism, personal conviction, and military strategy**:\n\n### 1. **Political Utility**\n- **Unity of Empire**: The Roman Empire in the early 4th century was fractured by civil wars and religious disputes. Christianity, with its strong organizational structure and universal message, offered a unifying ideology across the empire.\n- **Support from Christians**: By the time of Constantine\u2019s rise, Christians made up a substantial and growing part of the population, particularly in the eastern provinces. Aligning with them offered a political advantage, especially against rivals like Maxentius and Licinius.\n\n### 2. **Military Context**\n- **Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312 CE)**: Before this decisive battle, Constantine claimed to have seen a vision of a cross of light with the words *in hoc signo vinces* (\"in this sign, you will conquer\"). Afterward, he attributed his victory to the Christian God, which reinforced the perceived power of the Christian deity over traditional Roman gods.\n\n### 3. **Personal Belief**\n- While some modern scholars doubt the sincerity of his faith, others point to Constantine's later actions \u2014 such as favoring Christian bishops, funding churches, and convening the Council of Nicaea \u2014 as signs of genuine commitment. He was baptized on his deathbed, in line with a contemporary view that baptism should be delayed until one\u2019s sins had mostly been lived through.\n\n### 4. **Religious Syncretism**\n- Constantine may have initially viewed Christianity through a syncretic lens \u2014 not necessarily abandoning traditional Roman religion at once, but seeing the Christian God as the most powerful among many. For years he still held titles like *Pontifex Maximus* and used Sol Invictus imagery, suggesting a gradual shift rather than sudden break.\n\nIn sum, Constantine\u2019s conversion was not a purely spiritual moment, nor was it solely cynical manipulation \u2014 it was likely a **complex, calculated, and evolving process** shaped by the religious and political needs of the empire.\n\nWould you like a breakdown of the historical sources supporting each interpretation?"

              "According to Christian belief, the body of Jesus was resurrected on the third day after his crucifixion, and thus it is no longer on Earth. This is a foundational tenet of Christian doctrine, particularly in Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions.\n\nFrom a historical or archaeological perspective, there is no verified physical remains of Jesus of Nazareth. Several sites claim to be his burial place, including:\n\n- **The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem**, which many Christians believe marks both the site of the crucifixion (Golgotha) and the tomb from which he rose.\n- **The Garden Tomb**, also in Jerusalem, which some Protestant groups consider a possible alternative.\n\nHowever, there is no scientific consensus or verified archaeological evidence of Jesus's remains, aligning with the theological claim of resurrection.\n\nWould you like to explore this from a historical, theological, or archaeological perspective?"
