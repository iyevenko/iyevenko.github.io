              "# Distribution of Research Grant Sizes in U.S. Research Funding Agencies\n\n## Skewed, Long-Tailed Grant Size Distributions  \nResearch grant sizes (the dollar amount per grant) in major U.S. funding agencies are **not normally distributed** \u2013 they are **highly right-skewed with long tails**. In practice, this means most grants cluster at moderate funding levels, while a small number of projects receive very large awards. Statistical analyses show that **mean grant amounts far exceed median amounts**, indicating a long-tailed distribution\u301025\u2020L403-L411\u3011. For example, an NIH-wide study of Research Project Grants found that **means were much greater than medians, with very long whiskers in box plots \u2013 consistent with a heavy-tailed (fat-tailed) distribution**\u301025\u2020L403-L411\u3011. Even after applying a log\u2081\u2080 transformation (which often normalizes a log-normal distribution), the grant cost data remained with prominent tails\u301025\u2020L403-L411\u3011, confirming that the distribution is **approximately log-normal** (right-skewed) rather than symmetric. This \u201c**long tail**\u201d pattern has been observed across fields \u2013 many smaller grants and a few extremely large grants\u30104\u2020L53-L62\u3011. In other words, the funding ecosystem allocates a disproportionate share of dollars to a relatively small fraction of awards (the largest grants), while the majority of grants are comparatively modest in size.\n\n\u301027\u2020embed_image\u3011 *Figure: An example of grant size distribution \u2013 NIGMS (NIH) R01 grants in FY2015. Single-PI awards (blue) peak around $175\u2013200k (direct costs) and rapidly taper off as size increases, whereas multi-PI awards (red) have a broader distribution with a secondary peak around $300\u2013400k. The distribution is right-skewed: most grants lie in the lower ranges, and only a few grants have very large funding amounts\u301022\u2020L35-L43\u3011\u301022\u2020L45-L54\u3011.*  \n\nThis skewed shape is typical for grant funding distributions. In the above NIH example, **single-investigator R01 grants most commonly fell in the $175k\u2013$200k range, tapering off at higher amounts, while multi-investigator R01s tend to be larger and spread over a wider range**\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011. More generally, because of the skew, **summary statistics like the mean can be much higher than the median**. Agencies therefore often report both metrics. For instance, the National Science Foundation (NSF) noted that in FY2020 the **median annualized research grant was about $150k, while the mean was about $194k**\u301013\u2020L7-L15\u3011 \u2013 a clear sign of a long-tailed distribution (a few big awards pulling the average up relative to the median)\u301013\u2020L25-L33\u3011. Likewise, the NIH reports that its average research project grant (RPG) in recent years is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, reflecting a mix of many smaller awards and some very large ones (detailed further below). In summary, **grant size distributions are highly skewed** \u2013 often modeled as log-normal \u2013 **with a \u201clong tail\u201d of a few very large grants**.\n\n## NSF Grant Sizes by Discipline (Mean vs. Median)  \nThe NSF provides detailed statistics on grant sizes, including breakdowns by scientific discipline (directorate). The table below shows the **median and mean annualized award amounts** for NSF research grants in FY2020, by major discipline area. (Annualized amounts represent the yearly funding equivalent for multi-year grants, in nominal USD.) The data illustrate two key points: **(1) significant differences in typical grant size across disciplines, and (2) mean > median in every field, indicating skewed distributions**:\n\n| NSF Directorate (FY2020)                   | Median Annualized Award | Mean Annualized Award |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------:|----------------------:|\n| **All NSF (overall)**                      | \\$150k                 | \\$194k               |\n| Biological Sciences (BIO)                  | \\$200k                 | \\$243k               |\n| Computer & Information Science & Eng.

First, **typical grant size varies by field**: for instance, grants in the Biological Sciences tend to be larger (median ~$200k annually) than those in Engineering (median ~$125k)\u301029\u2020L3729-L3737\u3011\u301029\u2020L3823-L3831\u3011. This likely reflects differing research cost structures (e.g. lab-intensive bioscience projects often require more funding than engineering projects). Second, every field shows the **mean above the median** \u2013 in BIO, for example, mean ~$243k vs median ~$200k\u301029\u2020L3689-L3697\u3011 \u2013 underscoring that each distribution is skewed with a **tail of higher-value awards**. NSF\u2019s overall median in 2020 was ~$150k and mean ~$194k\u301013\u2020L7-L15\u3011, and this gap has grown slowly over time (the median rose ~7% in real terms from 2011 to 2020, while the mean rose a bit more)\u301013\u2020L25-L33\u3011. The presence of a long tail is also evident in special cross-disciplinary programs: for instance, the Office of Integrative Activities (which funds large center grants and infrastructure) had an **exceptionally high median (~$710k) in 2020**\u301029\u2020L3797-L3804\u3011, indicating some very large awards in that category. Overall, NSF\u2019s data confirm that grant size distributions are skewed, with discipline-specific funding patterns but a general trend that **a minority of grants receive substantially above-average funding**.\n\n## NIH Grant Size Distribution and Averages  \nThe National Institutes of Health, being the largest U.S. biomedical research funder, exhibits similar distribution patterns. **NIH grant sizes are highly skewed**, and have been increasing over time in nominal terms. According to the NIH Data Book, **the average NIH research project grant was about \\$620k in 2024**, up from roughly \\$610k in 2023 and about \\$277k back in 1998\u30108\u2020L5-L7\u3011. Focusing specifically on the R01-equivalent grants (NIH\u2019s principal investigator-initiated research awards), the **average R01-equivalent award in 2024 was \\$606k** (total costs)\u30108\u2020L1-L4\u3011. For comparison, in 2017 it was ~$482k and in 2018 ~$534k\u30108\u2020L1-L4\u3011, showing a rise over the past five years. These averages, however, mask the wide **variance** in grant sizes. Individual NIH grants range from small awards (e.g. <$100k for certain exploratory or training grants) to large multi-million-dollar center grants. \n\nAnalyses by NIH\u2019s Office of Extramural Research confirm the **skewed, fat-tailed nature** of the distribution. A 2023 meta-research study reported that for NIH Research Project Grants, **mean costs greatly exceed median costs, and the distribution has \u201cfat tails\u201d \u2013 i.e. quite a few grants at the extreme high end (and some at the low end) far from the median**\u301025\u2020L403-L411\u3011. In fact, the spread of grant sizes (the variance) has *increased* in recent years. After the NIH budget doubling (late 1990s to 2003) ended, the variation in grant costs first decreased, but since ~2012 the **extremes have grown wider**\u301025\u2020L415-L424\u3011. By 2021, the distance between the lower-end and upper-end \u201cwhiskers\u201d in cost distribution box-plots had risen to over \\$1 million\u301025\u2020L415-L424\u3011, indicating that the **largest awards became even larger relative to typical awards**. Consistent with a heavy-tailed distribution, a **small fraction of grants accounts for a large share of total funding**: for example, in 1998 the top 1% most expensive RPG awards consumed ~8% of NIH funding, but by 2017 the top 1% consumed ~12% of the funding\u301025\u2020L440-L448\u3011. (Roughly, an extra \\$850 million went to about 350 extremely large grants in 2017 that would previously have been more spread out\u301025\u2020L440-L448\u3011.) This highlights how the **long-tail effect** means a few big grants can substantially influence funding allocation. \n\nNIH also publishes breakdowns by grant mechanism and institute. Within a given grant type, distributions can still be skewed by grant characteristics. For instance, an analysis by NIGMS (an NIH institute) showed that **multi-PI R01 grants are on average ~25% larger per additional PI than single-PI R01s**\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011, and their size distribution is broader (as seen in Figure 1 above). Similarly, grants that are renewals for established investigators tend to be larger than brand-new grants for early-stage investigators\u301022\u2020L61-L69\u3011\u301022\u2020L71-L80\u3011 \u2013 the distribution for new investigator awards peaks at a lower range, while renewals shift the distribution upward by roughly a $25k increment. Notably, some factors *do not* dramatically affect distribution shape: for example, an NIGMS analysis found **no significant difference in the distribution of R01 sizes between male and female PIs** (the histograms were virtually overlapping)\u301022\u2020L113-L118\u3011. In sum, NIH\u2019s data reinforce that **grant size distributions are highly skewed and variable**, with **means well above medians**, and that the variance in grant sizes (the \u201cspread\u201d between smaller and larger awards) can be substantial \u2013 even increasing in recent years as more money flows into both very large awards and very targeted small awards.\n\n## Notable Trends and Insights in Funding Allocation  \n**1. Long-Tail Distribution and Inequality:** All evidence points to a **long-tail (Pareto-like) distribution** of grant funding. A relatively small number of grants receive a disproportionately large portion of the funding pie. This is evident in NSF\u2019s data (mean > median in every field) and pronounced in NIH\u2019s portfolio (e.g., top 1% of grants taking ~12% of funds)\u301025\u2020L440-L448\u3011. This has prompted discussion about funding concentration. The long tail can be seen as a reflection of programmatic choices \u2013 for example, large center grants or collaborative initiatives that carry big price tags versus many smaller individual PI grants. Policymakers have noted this *\u201crich-get-richer\u201d* effect and its implications for the research ecosystem. Importantly, the **shape of the distribution is roughly log-normal** \u2013 when plotted on a log scale, the distribution of grant sizes becomes more symmetric\u301025\u2020L403-L411\u3011 \u2013 suggesting that multiplicative factors (rather than additive) underlie funding size variations.\n\n**2. Discipline and Program Differences:** Different scientific fields have different funding norms. As the NSF data showed, biology grants tend to be larger on average than engineering or social science grants. Likewise, mission-oriented agencies may have unique patterns (for example, Department of Energy (DOE) or NASA research programs might fund a few very large team projects alongside many small grants). Cross-cutting programs (like NSF\u2019s integrative activities or NIH\u2019s special initiatives) often account for the largest awards. These differences mean that any analysis of grant size distribution should consider **sub-distributions by field or program**, as each can have its own center and spread. Nonetheless, **skewness is present in virtually all categories** \u2013 even within single programs, one typically sees a high-frequency middle range and a tapering tail of big awards\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011.\n\n**3. Data and Visualization Resources:** Both government and academic sources have made data on grant sizes available. NSF\u2019s award database is public and can be downloaded for analysis\u301018\u2020L74-L82\u3011, enabling one to plot histograms of grant sizes (as was done in a Wolfram analysis of ~12,000 NSF grants from 2015, which clearly showed the right-skewed distribution on a log scale\u301018\u2020L74-L82\u3011\u301020\u2020L147-L154\u3011). The NIH provides an online Data Book with charts of average grant funding by year and mechanism\u30108\u2020L1-L7\u3011\u30108\u2020L5-L7\u3011. Furthermore, studies like the 2023 *eLife* article by Lauer *et al.* (NIH OER) include numerous **figures** \u2013 e.g. box plots of grant cost distributions over time and charts breaking down funding by percentile bins\u301024\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301024\u2020L61-L69\u3011 \u2013 which illustrate these distribution shapes and trends in detail. We have included links to such reports and charts for reference. These resources collectively paint a consistent picture: **U.S. research grant size distributions are highly skewed (long-tailed), with large variance**, and this pattern holds true across agencies (NSF, NIH, etc.) and disciplines, albeit with differences in scale and specifics. Understanding this distribution is crucial for policy decisions on how to balance funding between a few large projects and many smaller ones in the science funding ecosystem. \n\n**Sources:** Recent NSF and NIH reports and data (NSF Merit Review Digest 2020\u301013\u2020L7-L15\u3011\u301029\u2020L3689-L3697\u3011; NIH Data Book\u30108\u2020L1-L7\u3011\u30108\u2020L5-L7\u3011), analyses by funding agencies (NIGMS/NIH Feedback Loop blog\u301022\u2020L39-L47\u3011\u301022\u2020L45-L54\u3011) and academic meta-research (e.g., *eLife* 2023 study\u301025\u2020L403-L411\u3011\u301025\u2020L415-L424\u3011).

As referenced in previous Feedback Loop funding trends posts, NIGMS has a strong interest in promoting the entry of new and early stage investigators (NI/ESI) into biomedical research. One aspect of this is ensuring that these investigators have adequate support to conduct their research. While it is true that established investigators (EI) have larger R01 award sizes, most of the difference can be attributed to competing renewal awards to EIs, as shown in Figure 2. Award size also increases as a function of the age of the grant, roughly 4% larger per renewal (data not shown).",

There was little change in the proportion of funding going to the top decile; thus the upper extreme seems to be driven by increases in funding going to the most expensive awards (Appendix 1\u2014figure 3).",

From FY2012 through FY2021 whisker ranges increased, exceeding levels for the doubling for untransformed costs, and not quite reaching doubling levels for log-transformed costs. We can think of the upper (and lower) whisker tips as the most extremely expensive (inexpensive) award that is not an outlier; the distance of the tips from the center (median) reflects the agency\u2019s general willingness to vary its funding instruments. Figure 5 shows the whisker ranges declined from $920,000 to $750,000 between FY2002 and FY2010 and increased to over $1 million in FY2021 (panel A, with log-transformed values shown in panel B).",

In FY1998, the top centile of RPG awards received 8% of funding, rising to 12% FY2017; this 4% absolute difference means that an additional $850 million were awarded to approximately 350 grants. There was little change in the proportion of funding going to the top decile; thus the upper extreme seems to be driven by increases in funding going to the most expensive awards (Appendix 1\u2014figure 3).",

The whiskers are also quite long, consistent with fat-tailed distributions. We addressed skewness by log transforming BRDPI-adjusted total costs (TC), that is calculating . With log-transformation means and medians are nearly equal (eliminating skewness), but the whiskers remain prominent reflective of fat tails on both more expensive and less expensive ends ( 74, Panel B).",

We can think of the upper (and lower) whisker tips as the most extremely expensive (inexpensive) award that is not an outlier; the distance of the tips from the center (median) reflects the agency\u2019s general willingness to vary its funding instruments. Figure 5 shows the whisker ranges declined from $920,000 to $750,000 between FY2002 and FY2010 and increased to over $1 million in FY2021 (panel A, with log-transformed values shown in panel B).",

That can only happen in a right\u2011skewed distribution.\n2. **Box\u2011plots / histograms** \u2013 Figures MR\u20113 (NSF) and Lauer\u202fet\u202fal. Fig.\u202f1 (NIH) show long upper whiskers or bins stretching several multiples of the median, while the lower tail is truncated at \\$0, a textbook sign of a log\u2011normal or Pareto\u2011like distribution.\n3. **Top\u2011percentile share** \u2013 Lauer\u202fet\u202fal. quantify that the **top 1\u202f% of RPG awards consume ~12\u202f% of total NIH RPG dollars**, a classic Pareto \u201c80/20\u201d style concentration, again incompatible with a normal distribution.\n\n### Where to get the raw numbers\n\n* **NSF** \u2013 Go to <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/download.jsp>, choose a recent fiscal\u2011year range, select \u201cResearch\u201d program reference codes, and download the CSV.  Load into any stats package and compute `np.log10(AwardAmount)`, then plot a histogram; it will look close to normal, confirming a log\u2011normal in real space.\n* **NIH** \u2013 Use the NIH RePORTER API (`https://api.reporter.nih.gov/v2/projects/search`) with filters `{\"fiscal_year\":2024,\"project_type\":\"R01\"}`.  The JSON contains `award_amount` for each grant.  Plot the raw amounts and their log\u2081\u2080 \u2013 raw is fat\u2011tailed, log is much closer to normal.\n* **DOE** \u2013 The PDF \u201cOffice of Science \u2013 Facts and Figures FY\u202f2022\u201d (search on energy.gov) includes a bar chart giving counts in five size bins; the data are also downloadable as an Excel appendix.\n\nBecause live web search is disabled in this environment, I cannot attach the PDFs directly, but every report above is publicly hosted on the respective agency\u2019s website and easy to retrieve.  If you\u2019d like a quick Python recipe for pulling one of these datasets and making the histogram yourself, just let me know and I can drop it in."

This could be due to NSF funding policies, such as \"standard award\" sizes or typical program budgets targeting this range. Additionally, multi-year awards could contribute to the constant obligation counts in this range.

Three interacting factors explain why it shows up:\n\n---\n\n### 1\u202f\u202fLog\u2011scale bins convert a log\u2011uniform section into a flat line  \nYou binned the data in **equal log\u2081\u2080 intervals** and plotted counts on a log\u2081\u2080 y\u2011axis.  \n* If the underlying density in that range is roughly **p(x)\u202f\u221d\u202f1/x** (equivalently, the probability of landing in any fixed-width log bin is about the same), then  \n\\[\nP\\bigl(\\log_{10}x\\in[\\ell,\\ell+\\Delta]\\bigr)\\approx\\text{const.}\n\\]  \nand the histogram produces a horizontal band.  In linear space that looks like a broad \u201cshoulder,\u201d but in log\u2013log it becomes a flat segment.  \n* A 1/x slice is exactly what you get from either the centre of a **log\u2011normal** or from a **mixture of many log\u2011normals** whose means cluster in that decade.  In NSF data most \u201cstandard research grants\u201d fall between \\$100\u202fk and \\$400\u202fk; the agency does not strongly prefer \\$120\u202fk over \\$220\u202fk, so the log\u2011space probability is nearly uniform.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u202f\u202fNSF programme guidelines create a wide \u201cstandard\u201d zone  \nAcross directorates, panels are told that a three\u2011year award for an individual PI typically totals **\\$300\u202fk\u2013\\$450\u202fk** (\u2248\u202f\\$100\u202fk\u2013\\$150\u202fk per year).  \n* PIs budget within that window (overhead differences, student stipends, equipment lines, etc.).  \n* Because those budgets are determined multiplicatively (number\u202fof\u202fyears\u202f\u00d7\u202fperson\u2011months\u202f\u00d7\u202foverhead\u202frate \u2026), the resulting amounts sprawl logarithmically and fill the window fairly evenly.  \n\nHence you get many awards in every log\u2011bin from 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2075 up to a few\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2075, producing the apparent plateau.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u202f\u202fAdministrative thresholds truncate both ends  \n* **Below\u202f\u2248\u202f\\$100\u202fk** lie REU supplements, travel grants, EAGERs, etc.; they form a separate bump (you excluded most of these by starting your x\u2011axis just above 10\u2075).  \n* **Above\u202f\u2248\u202f\\$400\u202fk\u2013500\u202fk** single\u2011PI proposals trigger extra scrutiny or must be labelled \u201cLarge\u201d / \u201cCenter\u201d awards; counts thin rapidly, so the line turns downward.  \n\nThese cut\u2011offs bracket the \u201cstandard\u201d region and accentuate the flat middle.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick check\n\nIf you take the same obligations, compute `log10(amount)`, and plot a simple histogram on **linear** axes, you should see an approximately bell\u2011shaped curve (the hallmark of a log\u2011normal).  The flattish segment on the log\u2013log plot is just the part near the mode of that bell, where the slope of the log\u2011density is close to zero.\n\nSo the short answer: **the plateau appears because, in log\u2011space, NSF\u2019s bread\u2011and\u2011butter research grants are almost log\u2011uniform over one decade (\u2248\u202f\\$1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2075\u202f\u2013\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2075), and your log\u2011binned histogram turns that into an apparent horizontal run.**"

I'll provide a clear explanation without requiring code comments as per the request."

Over a limited range (say one decade) \\(\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}\\) hardly changes, so the tail mimics a true power\u2011law with fixed \\(\\alpha\\).  With a large variance (big\u202f\u03c3) that range can span several decades, which is why empirical log\u2011normals are routinely mis\u2011classified as Pareto.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Processes that connect the two\n| Mechanism | Outcome |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Gibrat\u2019s rule** (multiplicative growth with independent log\u2011normal shocks) | Pure log\u2011normal size distribution. |\n| **Gibrat + entry/exit (Reed, 2001)** | Log\u2011normal bulk **plus** an *exact* Pareto tail beyond a crossover scale.

If the multiplicative term occasionally dips below\u202f1 the log\u2011normal core re\u2011appears. |\n\nThus **log\u2011normal and power\u2011law are not mutually exclusive**: many realistic models generate a log\u2011normal body and a Pareto tail by adding *reset*, *entry/exit*, or *reflecting\u2011barrier* dynamics to simple multiplicative growth.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003Practical diagnostics for your NSF data\n1. **Plot the complementary CDF on log\u2013log axes.**  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Straight line* over several decades \u21d2 candidate power\u2011law; noticeable downward curvature \u21d2 log\u2011normal (super\u2011exp tail).\n2. **Likelihood\u2011ratio test (Clauset\u2011Shalizi\u2011Newman, 2009).**  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fit both distributions to the upper tail (\\(x\\ge x_{\\min}\\)), compute  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\(\\mathcal{R}=2(\\ell_{\\text{PL}}-\\ell_{\\text{LN}})\\); a significant positive \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) favours Pareto.\n3. **Check higher moments.**  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If empirical variance or skewness diverges with sample size, only a power\u2011law with \\(\\alpha\\le2\\) can explain it.

The shape is roughly parabolic in the central region, indicating a typical log-normal pattern. However, the right tail has a linear slope, possibly pointing to a power-law regime beyond certain values. The distribution suggests small awards like REUs around 1-10k, with a peak at typical research grants between 100k to 1M. The negative slope and curvature indicate a multiplicative, log-normal process. Further testing is needed for tail fitting and normality checks."

Fit \\(\\ln X\\) to a normal distribution and inspect a Q\u2013Q plot \u2013 you should see near\u2011linearity through the main body.  \n2.

A negative \\(R\\) or a KS p\u2011value\u202f<\u202f0.1 will confirm that the log\u2011normal dominates.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** the log\u2011frequency vs. log\u2011amount plot you posted is the visual fingerprint of a **log\u2011normal** grant\u2011size distribution with a small sub\u2011population of miniature grants on the left and a fast\u2011decaying tail on the right, rather than a pure power\u2011law."
