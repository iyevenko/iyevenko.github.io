This could be causing the issue since they meant for the figure to fit within a single column. A quick fix could be using `figure*` for a full-width figure, or setting a smaller width, say `0.45\\textwidth`, to fit within one column."

              "# Dynamical Systems Concepts in Cellular Automata: A Literature Overview\n\nCellular automata (CA) have long been studied as **dynamical systems**, including in the artificial life (ALife) community\u301023\u2020L37-L45\u3011. Early research by Ulam, von Neumann, and Conway (e.g. the Game of Life) showed that simple local rules can produce rich, emergent behaviors\u301028\u2020L281-L289\u3011. Over the decades, numerous researchers have explicitly applied dynamical-systems concepts \u2013 *attractors*, *fractals*, *Lyapunov exponents*, *phase transitions*, etc. \u2013 to analyze CA, continuous-state CA (CCA), and related ALife models. Below, we organize significant mentions from the literature by theme, highlighting primary academic sources in each category.\n\n## Attractors and Basins of Attraction in CA  \nOne fundamental approach is to treat a finite CA as a discrete dynamical system that eventually falls into **attractors** (usually periodic cycles or fixed points) with corresponding **basins of attraction**. This terminology was explicitly borrowed from continuous dynamics: an attractor is the repeating cycle of states in which the system settles, and a basin is the set of all trajectories (transient states) leading into a given attractor\u301031\u2020L39-L47\u3011. In 1992, Andrew Wuensche and Mike Lesser produced an *atlas* of basins of attraction for 1-D binary CA, mapping out the global state-space dynamics for various rules\u301022\u2020L21-L25\u3011. Their book *The Global Dynamics of Cellular Automata* systematically enumerated state transition graphs (trees of transient states flowing into point attractors or cycles) for small CA rules, helping classify behaviors as ordered, complex, or chaotic. Around the same time, Hurley (1990) provided a theoretical classification of attractors in CA from a dynamical-systems perspective\u301014\u2020L1288-L1295\u3011. Hurley\u2019s work in *Ergodic Theory & Dynamical Systems* gave formal conditions for the persistence and density of attractor basins in cellular automata, offering a rigorous underpinning to the empirical \u201cbasin of attraction\u201d analyses. Subsequent reviews (e.g. Wuensche 2017\u301031\u2020L39-L47\u3011) continued to refine these concepts, emphasizing that convergent (injective) CA dynamics yield a tree-like basin topology rooted on attractor cycles (including fixed-point attractors as a special case).\n\n## Fractal Patterns and Critical Attractors in CA  \nMany cellular automata display **fractal** patterns or attractors, linking them to concepts of strange attractors in chaos theory. A classic example is Wolfram\u2019s elementary CA *Rule\u00a090*, which, when started from a single active cell, produces a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle \u2013 a well-known fractal \u2013 in its space-time diagram\u301034\u2020L149-L157\u3011. In fact, the repetitive triangular motif of Rule\u00a090 has a self-similar structure, and more generally any initial configuration with finitely many 1s evolves as a superposition of Sierpi\u0144ski-like patterns\u301034\u2020L149-L157\u3011. This inherent generation of fractals by CA was noted in early studies (e.g. by Wolfram and coworkers in the 1980s) and has been discussed in later analyses of linear/additive CA\u301033\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Beyond spatial fractals, researchers have also observed **fractal time dynamics** in CA. For instance, Ninagawa *et al.* (1998) reported **$1/f$ power-law noise** in the long-term activity of Conway\u2019s Game of Life\u301021\u2020L3088-L3092\u3011, indicating scale-invariant (self-similar) temporal fluctuations. Such $1/f$ behavior is a hallmark of systems at criticality and suggests that Life evolves near a critical (edge-of-chaos) attractor.\n\nAnother important connection is to **self-organized criticality (SOC)**, which emerged from simple CA models.  Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld\u2019s sandpile automaton (1987) famously showed that a slowly-driven CA can spontaneously reach a **critical attractor** \u2013 essentially an attractor that is a critical point of a phase transition\u301028\u2020L251-L259\u3011. At this SOC state, the system exhibits **scale-invariance** in both space and time: avalanches of all sizes occur with power-law distributions, producing fractal spatial patterns and $1/f$ (pink) noise\u301028\u2020L293-L298\u3011. In other words, the critical point itself behaves as an attractor for the dynamics\u301028\u2020L251-L259\u3011, with the macroscopic behavior showing fractal characteristics without fine-tuning of parameters. This finding linked CA to fractal phenomena in nature and has been highly influential in ALife and complexity science, illustrating how **fractal attractors** can arise in discrete systems. Subsequent work extended SOC ideas to other CA (forest-fire models, earthquake CA models, etc.), reinforcing that many CA-based models of nature reach attractor states characterized by fractal structure and multi-scale dynamics\u301028\u2020L293-L298\u3011.\n\n## Lyapunov Exponents and Chaos in CA  \n**Lyapunov exponents**, a key quantitative measure of chaos (sensitivity to initial conditions) in continuous dynamical systems, have been adapted to cellular automata since the early 1990s. Because CA have discrete state spaces, defining an analog of Lyapunov exponent required clever approaches. Shereshevsky (1992) provided one of the first formal definitions of Lyapunov exponents for one-dimensional CA\u301021\u2020L3079-L3087\u3011. His work in *Journal of Nonlinear Science* treated CA as dynamical maps on symbol sequences and defined Lyapunov exponents to quantify how small perturbations (e.g. flipping a single cell) grow or shrink over time in 1-D CA.\n\nAround the same time, physicists introduced *practical* Lyapunov measures via **damage-spreading experiments**. Bagnoli, Rechtman, and Ruffo (1992) defined a \u201cmaximal Lyapunov exponent\u201d for CA by observing the evolution of two nearly identical configurations (one with a single bit flipped)\u301021\u2020L3080-L3087\u3011. In their *Physics Letters\u00a0A* paper \u201cDamage Spreading and Lyapunov Exponents in CA\u201d, they used the Boolean difference (damage) to see if small differences expand (chaotic behavior) or die out (ordered behavior)\u301021\u2020L3080-L3087\u3011. This approach allowed classification of elementary CA rules as chaotic or not, analogous to how positive Lyapunov exponents indicate chaos in continuous systems\u301021\u2020L3080-L3087\u3011. The same authors and collaborators continued refining these ideas throughout the 1990s \u2013 for example, studying **Boolean derivatives** of the CA update rule to compute Lyapunov numbers more directly\u30105\u2020L163-L172\u3011\u30105\u2020L179-L187\u3011. By the late \u201990s, Bagnoli and Rechtman (1999) even examined **synchronization** in cellular automata and its relationship to maximum Lyapunov exponents\u30105\u2020L195-L201\u3011, drawing parallels to synchronization in chaotic oscillators.\n\nIn the 2000s, further advancements were made in formalizing Lyapunov analysis of CA. Tisseur (2000) published a study in *Nonlinearity* on \u201cCellular automata and Lyapunov exponents\u201d, offering a rigorous treatment for 1-D CA including additive and non-additive cases\u301020\u2020L55-L63\u3011. Courbage and Kami\u0144ski (2006) introduced **space\u2013time Lyapunov exponents** for CA\u301021\u2020L3098-L3100\u3011\u301021\u2020L3090-L3094\u3011, to capture directional growth rates of perturbations in space-time evolution (J. Stat. Phys. 124). More recently, Baetens and De Baets (2011) investigated the **topological sensitivity** of CA in an interdisciplinary nonlinear science journal, using Lyapunov-like measures to compare stability under synchronous vs. asynchronous updating\u301020\u2020L5-L13\u3011\u301020\u2020L7-L15\u3011. And in *Journal of Cellular Automata*, Baetens and Gravner (2018) introduced **Lyapunov profiles** for CA \u2013 essentially mapping out how sensitivity varies across different scales or directions in the automaton\u301020\u2020L23-L30\u3011. These developments demonstrate a rich literature adapting Lyapunov analysis to discrete systems. In summary, the consensus is that many CA (especially those in Wolfram\u2019s class III \u201cchaotic\u201d category) do show positive Lyapunov exponents in a coarse-grained sense, meaning they amplify small perturbations and have **sensitive dependence on initial conditions**\u301020\u2020L1-L9\u3011. This quantification has strengthened the analogy between CA rule-space **phase transitions** and conventional chaotic dynamics\u301021\u2020L3087-L3094\u3011\u301021\u2020L3080-L3087\u3011.\n\n## Edge-of-Chaos and Phase Transitions in CA  \nThe **edge of chaos** is a prominent theme in ALife and dynamical systems discussions of cellular automata. Langton (1990) famously explored how 1-D CA rules undergo a **phase transition** from order to chaos as a function of a parameter $\\lambda$ (the fraction of rule outputs that are non-quiescent)\u301023\u2020L1-L9\u3011\u301023\u2020L43-L47\u3011. In his paper *\u201cComputation at the edge of chaos: phase transitions and emergent computation\u201d*, Langton showed that intermediate-$\\lambda$ rules lie at a **critical regime** between periodic order and randomness, and that these \u201cedge of chaos\u201d rules support the most complex, life-like structures and even universal computation\u301023\u2020L37-L45\u3011\u301023\u2020L43-L47\u3011. This built on earlier observations by Packard and Wolfram that CA exhibit distinct **behavior classes** (ordered, chaotic, complex) and that maximal complexity often occurs at a transition point. For example, Packard, Wolfram and others had noted certain rules (later termed \u201cclass IV\u201d) produce persistent structures and long transients \u2013 suggestive of complexity on the border of stability and chaos. In *Physica\u00a0D* 1990, Li, Packard, and Langton systematically studied **transition phenomena in CA rule-space**, confirming that as one tunes $\\lambda$, one encounters a phase transition beyond which small changes lead to chaotic patterns\u301021\u2020L3085-L3092\u3011\u301023\u2020L49-L52\u3011. This was among the first quantitative demonstrations of a **critical point in rule-space** for cellular automata.\n\nThe edge-of-chaos concept resonated strongly in the artificial life literature. Langton (1986) had already argued that cellular automata could serve as *artificial life laboratories*, with life-like self-organization occurring in that narrow regime between order and disorder\u301023\u2020L37-L45\u3011. Subsequent ALife works expanded on this idea. For instance, Mitchell, Crutchfield and Das (1993) evolved cellular automata to perform computational tasks and found that evolution tends to select rules near this critical regime (where information propagation is neither frozen nor random). The **emergent complexity** at the edge of chaos is often associated with having a **diverse repertoire of attractors** and long-lived transients (metastability). From a dynamical systems view, this corresponds to a **complex attractor landscape** with many shallow basins, enabling information storage and processing. Indeed, as Langton and others pointed out, computation requires a balance of stability (to store information) and instability (to transmit and modify it)\u301023\u2020L43-L47\u3011. Thus, the broader lesson from these studies is that CA demonstrate a **dynamical phase transition** akin to a second-order phase transition, and that this critical point is extraordinarily significant for ALife: it is believed to be where replicators, complex patterns, and even artificial \u201cliving\u201d behaviors are possible in cellular automata\u301023\u2020L43-L47\u3011.\n\n## Continuous Cellular Automata and Dynamical Analysis  \nNot all cellular automata are purely discrete in state or deterministic \u2013 a body of work exists on **continuous cellular automata (CCA)** (also called analog or real-valued CA) and on stochastic or asynchronous variants, all studied with dynamical systems tools. In continuous-state CA, each cell\u2019s value is a real (or continuous) variable, and the update rule may be a continuous map (for example, a logistic map or other nonlinear function) applied locally with neighbors. These systems can often be analyzed by examining the **local map\u2019s attractors and bifurcations**. For example, one can view a CCA as a lattice of coupled logistic maps \u2013 a form of **coupled map lattice**, a concept introduced by Kaneko in the late 1980s to study spatiotemporal chaos. Researchers have noted that continuous CA **\u201cdisplay the rich and often chaotic dynamics\u201d** found in standard (discrete) CA\u301037\u2020L7-L10\u3011. In fact, Stephen Wolfram showed examples of continuous automata rules that yield behavior analogous to chaotic discrete CA\u301037\u2020L7-L10\u3011, reinforcing that adding continuity does not remove the possibility of complex dynamics.\n\nAnalysis of CCA often focuses on the *fixed points and periodic orbits* of the update function (the \u201cmap\u201d), since the map\u2019s parameter changes can lead to **bifurcations** in the CA\u2019s global behavior\u301030\u2020L1353-L1361\u3011. For instance, if each cell updates as $x_{t+1} = f(x_t\\text{ and neighbors})$ with $f$ a logistic-type function, varying a parameter $r$ in $f$ can cause transitions from a single stable state to oscillations or chaos in the spatial pattern\u301030\u2020L1353-L1361\u3011. Thus, *behavior-based classifications* of continuous/state CA often mirror bifurcation diagrams of the local map. Baetens and De Baets (2011) note that the attractor structure of the local map (location and stability of fixed points) largely determines the global behavior class of a CCA\u301030\u2020L1353-L1361\u3011. As parameters change, one can observe **period-doubling, chaos onset, or other bifurcations** at the global level, analogous to those in low-dimensional dynamical systems. Tools from coupled-map lattice theory \u2013 such as Lyapunov spectra, correlation dimensions, and entropy measures \u2013 have been employed to quantify complexity in CCA\u301030\u2020L1359-L1363\u3011. For example, Chate and Manneville (1992) studied a real-valued CA (a lattice of logistic maps with diffusion) and measured its Lyapunov exponents to characterize chaos in the spatially extended system. More recently, Vispoel *et al.* (2020) and others extended Lyapunov analyses to multi-state or fuzzy CA, examining how even the notion of perturbation sensitivity must be generalized when states are continuous or more complex than binary\u301030\u2020L1345-L1354\u3011\u301030\u2020L1351-L1359\u3011.\n\nIn addition, *asynchronous* and *stochastic* CA \u2013 often used in ALife models and agent-based simulations \u2013 have been examined via dynamical concepts. For instance, irregular update timings or random topology can induce qualitative shifts (akin to phase transitions) in CA behavior. Baetens and colleagues demonstrated that switching from synchronous to asynchronous update can significantly alter a CA\u2019s **Lyapunov stability** and may even trigger a transition from order to chaos\u301020\u2020L7-L15\u3011\u301020\u2020L37-L45\u3011. Likewise, CA on irregular networks (non-uniform lattice) can exhibit **topology-induced phase transitions**, where the network structure itself influences whether the system settles to order or chaos\u301020\u2020L37-L45\u3011. These studies extend the dynamical systems framework to more general \u201cartificial life\u201d automata that relax the strict regularity of classical CA.\n\n## Conclusion and Further Reading  \nIn summary, the literature demonstrates a deep cross-fertilization between cellular automata research and dynamical systems theory. **Attractors** (including basins and state-space structures), **fractal** patterns (spatial and temporal), **Lyapunov exponents** (and related chaos indicators), and **phase transitions** (edge-of-chaos phenomena) have all been pivotal in understanding how complex behavior arises in CA and CCA. Early works like Schulman & Seiden (1978) even treated Conway\u2019s Life with tools from statistical mechanics\u301021\u2020L3073-L3079\u3011, illustrating how broadly applicable these concepts are. Modern surveys (e.g. Baetens & De Baets 2020) provide comprehensive taxonomies that integrate these dynamical measures\u301020\u2020L1-L9\u3011\u301020\u2020L49-L57\u3011. For those interested, primary sources such as **Wuensche & Lesser (1992)** on global CA dynamics, **Langton (1990)** on the edge of chaos, **Bagnoli *et al.* (1992)** on CA Lyapunov exponents, and **Kaneko (1989, 1992)** on coupled-map lattices offer foundational insights. The continued study of CA through the lens of dynamical systems not only advances theoretical understanding but also cements CA\u2019s relevance as models of real-world complex systems in the ALife arena\u301028\u2020L251-L259\u3011\u301028\u2020L293-L298\u3011.\n\n**Sources:** Primary literature as cited above, including journals *Physica\u00a0D*, *Physical Review Letters*, *Journal of Cellular Automata*, *Journal of Statistical Physics*, *Nonlinearity*, and proceedings in ALife and complexity sciences.

              "### 1. What a Lyapunov exponent *really* is\n\nFor a **discrete-time dynamical system**\n\n\\[\nx_{k+1}=F(x_k),\\qquad F:\\mathbb R^{n}\\to\\mathbb R^{n},\n\\]\n\nthe (maximal) Lyapunov exponent at a point \\(x_0\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\max}(x_0)=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac1k\\log \\|DF^{k}(x_0)\\|,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(DF^{k}(x_0)=DF(x_{k-1})\\cdots DF(x_0)\\) is the time-\\(k\\) Jacobian.  \nThe infinite-time limit is essential: it washes out every finite (\u201ctransient\u201d) effect and tells you the *asymptotic* exponential rate at which infinitesimal perturbations of the trajectory grow/shrink.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Finite-time maps: there is no asymptote to take\n\n*If you never iterate the map*, i.e. you evaluate \\(y = F(x)\\) **once** (a feed-forward multilayer perceptron is exactly this), then\n\n\\[\nDF^{1}(x)=DF(x),\n\\]\n\nand the expression above stops there.  The usual Lyapunov-exponent limit cannot even be formed; \\(k\\) is fixed at 1.  What you *can* talk about is\n\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\log\\sigma_i\\!\\left(DF(x)\\right)}_{\\text{log-singular values}} ,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma_i\\) are the singular values of the Jacobian at the input.  These numbers tell you the one-shot linearised expansion/contraction factors along orthogonal directions, but calling them *Lyapunov exponents* is an abuse of the standard terminology because no long-time average is involved.\n\n> **Bottom line:** for a single evaluation of an MLP you have sensitivity exponents (log-singular values), **not** Lyapunov exponents in the dynamical-systems sense.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Two ways people *do* get Lyapunov-type quantities from an MLP\n\n| Perspective | Idea | What actually gets iterated | When the limit makes sense |\n|-------------|------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Depth-as-time** | View each layer \\(h_{l+1}=G_l(h_l)\\) as a time step; the Jacobian product over layers plays the role of \\(DF^{k}\\). | Layers themselves (weights untied). | If the network is *very deep* and the composition of *different* \\(G_l\\) stabilises statistically (e.g. random i.i.d. weights), FTLEs can converge. |\n| **Weight-tying / RNN** | Tie weights and iterate the same cell: \\(h_{t+1}=G(h_t)\\) \u2013 this *is* a dynamical system. | The same map \\(G\\). | Standard Lyapunov exponents apply; limits exist under Oseledets hypotheses. |\n\nIf neither of these constructions is present, you only have a *finite-time* object.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs)\n\nWhen one still wants a rate for a *finite* horizon \\(k\\),\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_i^{(k)}(x_0)=\\frac1k\\log\\sigma_i\\!\\left(DF^{k}(x_0)\\right),\n\\]\n\nis widely used (fluid mechanics, forecasting error growth, etc.).  FTLEs converge to genuine Lyapunov exponents if \\(k\\to\\infty\\) and the hypotheses of the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem hold; otherwise they remain horizon-dependent diagnostics.\n\nFor an MLP with \\(L\\) layers viewed as a depth-\\(L\\) composition,\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_i^{(L)}(x_0)=\\tfrac1L\\log\\sigma_i\\!\\bigl(DG_{L-1}(x_{L-1})\\cdots DG_0(x_0)\\bigr),\n\\]\n\nbut you must remember \\(L\\) is fixed by architecture, so \\(\\lambda_i^{(L)}\\) is merely a *scaled* log-singular value.  As \\(L\\) grows (e.g. depth-scaling limits), one can start speaking of asymptotics.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Practical consequences for MLPs\n\n* **Sensitivity / robustness**\u2003Use \\(\\sigma_{\\max}(DF(x))\\) (or its log) to bound how input perturbations can blow up at the output.  This is the quantity certification and adversarial-robustness papers estimate.\n* **Gradient vanishing/explosion**\u2003During training the same singular values of the *layer* Jacobians control back-propagation stability; again finite products, not asymptotic exponents.\n* **Chaos claims**\u2003Occasionally the term \u201cLyapunov exponent\u201d is borrowed to dramatise sensitivity of very deep nets, but one should always check whether a true time-asymptotic limit is being taken.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Take-away\n\n*If there is no repeated composition of the **same** map, Lyapunov exponents in the strict dynamical-systems sense do not exist.*  \nWhat you have are one-step (or finite-step) expansion rates given by the singular values of the relevant Jacobian products.  They are extremely useful, but they are *finite-time* objects and should be labelled accordingly."

              "# Jacobian Singular Values in AI: Interpretability and Generalization \u2013 A Literature Review\n\n## 1. Background and Motivation \nJacobian singular values (the singular values of a model\u2019s Jacobian matrix with respect to its inputs or parameters) quantify how **sensitive a model\u2019s output is to changes in its input**. Intuitively, the Jacobian captures the local linear behavior of a neural network: directions in input space corresponding to large singular values can cause large changes in the output (high sensitivity), whereas small singular values indicate directions where the output is locally invariant. This sensitivity is fundamental to understanding both model **interpretability** and **generalization**. For example, large Jacobian norms (e.g. large Frobenius norm or spectral norm) often correlate with models that are not robust to input perturbations or adversarial noise. Conversely, models that generalize well tend to be more stable (smoother) around the data manifold, which corresponds to smaller Jacobian norms in those regions\u301016\u2020L59-L67\u3011. Indeed, an empirical study by Novak et al. (2018) demonstrated that networks which generalize better are **more robust to input perturbations near the training data**, as measured by a smaller input-output Jacobian norm\u301016\u2020L59-L67\u3011. They found that training conditions known to hurt generalization (e.g. using random labels or very large batch sizes) lead to higher sensitivity (larger Jacobian norm), while techniques that improve generalization (data augmentation, appropriate non-linearities) produce functions with lower Jacobian norms\u301016\u2020L61-L69\u3011. This aligns with the long-held manifold hypothesis: real-world data lie on low-dimensional manifolds, so a well-behaved model should be **insensitive to perturbations off that data manifold**\u30108\u2020L99-L107\u3011. In other words, the function should vary only along relevant directions and remain flat in other directions. Jacobian singular values directly measure this, as a **low-rank or small Jacobian** implies the model\u2019s output changes only along a limited set of input directions\u30108\u2020L99-L107\u3011.\n\nBeyond empirical observations, there are strong theoretical motivations for studying Jacobian spectra. The Jacobian\u2019s largest singular value is the local Lipschitz constant of the network\u2019s mapping; controlling this (or the entire spectrum) is important for **stability and adversarial robustness**. Early works (circa 1990s) recognized that penalizing a network\u2019s input-output derivatives can prevent overfitting by encouraging smoother functions (notably, *Drucker & Le Cun 1992* regularized first-order derivatives to improve generalization). Modern deep learning research has revisited these ideas: for example, Ciss\u00e9 et al. (2017) constrained the spectral norms of weight matrices (\u201cParseval networks\u201d) to limit the Lipschitz constant and found improved adversarial robustness\u301020\u2020L5-L9\u3011. Likewise, contractsive autoencoders (Rifai et al., 2011) penalized the Frobenius norm of the encoder\u2019s Jacobian to learn robust, invariant features. All these indicate that **Jacobian singular values matter** because they connect to a model\u2019s capacity, stability, and invariances. A network with overwhelmingly large Jacobian singular values can overly contort the input space (fitting noise or irrelevant features), whereas a network with appropriately small singular values (especially in irrelevant directions) tends to focus on the dominant underlying structure and thus generalize better\u301022\u2020L1-L4\u3011\u301023\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Recent theoretical work by Wu and Li (2024) further solidified this link, proving that **reducing the norm of the Jacobian improves both standard generalization and adversarial (robust) generalization**\u301022\u2020L1-L4\u3011. In summary, Jacobian singular values are a window into how \u201ccomplex\u201d or \u201cstable\u201d a learned function is \u2013 a key reason they have become a focus for interpretability and generalization studies in modern AI.\n\n## 2. Key Methodologies for Studying Jacobian Spectra \nResearch from 2020 onwards has developed several methodologies to analyze and control Jacobian singular values in deep networks. A first line of work is **theoretical analysis** of random or trained networks to understand their Jacobian spectrum. For instance, investigators have applied tools from random matrix theory and differential geometry to characterize typical singular value distributions. A notable example is Oymak et al. (2020), who observed that **trained neural nets often have a Jacobian with a few large singular values and many near-zero singular values**, indicating an approximately low-rank transformation\u301013\u2020L41-L47\u3011. They introduced a theoretical \u201ccontrol knob\u201d to split the Jacobian\u2019s spectrum into an \u201cinformation subspace\u201d (spanned by large singular values) and a \u201cnuisance subspace\u201d (small singular values), and showed that learning proceeds rapidly in the information subspace and much more slowly in the nuisance subspace\u301013\u2020L31-L39\u3011. Such analysis provides insights into why neural networks can generalize despite high parameter count \u2013 effectively, the function they learn operates in a much lower-dimensional subspace of inputs, as evidenced by the low effective rank of the Jacobian. Another recent analytical approach linearizes the entire **training process**: Belrose & Scherlis (2024) computed the Jacobian of final parameters w.r.t. initial parameters for small networks, revealing a spectrum with three regions (\u201cchaotic\u201d singular values >> 1, a bulk near 1, and \u201cstable\u201d singular values < 1)\u301038\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301038\u2020L15-L23\u3011. Interestingly, they found that along the bulk directions (singular values \u2248 1) the network\u2019s parameter updates are almost an *isometry* \u2013 perturbations at initialization carry through training unchanged and do *not* affect in-distribution performance, though they do affect out-of-distribution behavior\u301038\u2020L15-L23\u3011. This kind of Jacobian-based analysis of training dynamics is an emerging methodology to understand the intrinsic dimensionality of learning. \n\nOn the empirical side, a key methodology is **computing or approximating Jacobian norms and spectra** for modern architectures. Directly computing the full Jacobian for each data point (which can be an enormous matrix) and performing SVD is usually intractable for high-dimensional inputs. Researchers have developed clever workarounds. One common approach is to estimate the **spectral norm** (largest singular value) using power iteration on the Jacobian or its adjoint. This is used, for example, in adversarial robustness certification and in spectral norm regularization of networks. In fact, one observation is that the process of generating an adversarial perturbation with iterative methods (like PGD) is effectively performing a power iteration to find the input direction of maximum output change \u2013 in other words, finding the top singular vector of the input-output Jacobian\u301011\u2020L59-L63\u3011. Qin et al. (2023) highlight that *\u201cthe adversarial samples\u2019 iterative generation procedure is the first-order approximation to the maximum singular vector of the Jacobian\u201d*, implying that adversarial training implicitly acts as a spectral-norm regularizer\u301011\u2020L59-L63\u3011. Apart from spectral norm estimation, researchers often compute the **Frobenius norm** of the Jacobian (which is easier, as it equals the norm of the input gradients for each output, squared and summed). This quantity can be averaged over data to gauge overall sensitivity. Novak et al. (2018) used this approach to correlate sensitivity with generalization, and others have used it in regularizers. Another set of techniques focuses on **layer-wise Jacobian analysis**: since for a feedforward network, the overall Jacobian is the product of layer Jacobians, one can bound or control singular values by ensuring each layer is well-conditioned (e.g., orthonormal weight initializations to preserve singular values ~1 throughout, known as *dynamical isometry*). This layer-wise view motivated methods like Parseval networks and spectral normalization of weights, which aim to keep singular values in check at each layer to constrain the whole network\u2019s Lipschitz constant\u301020\u2020L5-L9\u3011. \n\nA significant recent advance in methodology is **Jacobian regularization techniques** that are computationally feasible for modern architectures. Hoffman, Roberts, and Yaida (2019) introduced an efficient way to penalize the *full input-output Jacobian norm* during training\u301027\u2020L50-L58\u3011. They showed that adding a Jacobian Frobenius norm term to the loss can increase classification margins and improve robustness without severely hurting clean accuracy\u301027\u2020L50-L58\u3011. Building on such ideas, researchers in the 2020s have proposed improvements to make Jacobian regularization scalable. For example, Scarvelis & Solomon (2024) present a method for **Jacobian nuclear norm regularization** \u2013 instead of directly computing the sum of singular values (the nuclear norm), they prove that for networks structured as compositions (which deep nets are), one can equivalently penalize the sum of squared Frobenius norms of intermediate Jacobians\u30108\u2020L113-L121\u3011\u30108\u2020L122-L130\u3011. This result is powerful: it avoids an explicit SVD on the full Jacobian by breaking the regularization into per-layer or per-module terms that are easier to compute. They further introduce a \u201cdenoising-style\u201d surrogate loss to approximate the nuclear norm penalty without computing any Jacobian at all, making it efficient\u30108\u2020L122-L130\u3011. Another example is the work of Lee et al. (2023), who studied **implicit Jacobian regularization** by SGD. They discovered that stochastic gradient descent itself naturally penalizes the Jacobian norm during training (especially when the model\u2019s predictive distribution is uncertain), a phenomenon they call *Implicit Jacobian Regularization*\u301019\u2020L5-L14\u3011. By monitoring the \u201clogit sensitivity\u201d (Jacobian of logits w.r.t. weights and inputs), they found SGD\u2019s dynamics initially allow the Jacobian norm to grow but later suppress it, coinciding with the phase when the training stabilizes. They even show that explicitly adding a Jacobian norm regularizer (what they call Explicit Jacobian Regularization) yields similar generalization boosts to other modern techniques like sharpness-aware minimization\u301019\u2020L5-L14\u3011. In summary, the methodologies to study Jacobian singular values range from *analytical decompositions* (splitting spectra into subspaces, linearizing training) to *computational techniques* (power iteration, trace estimation, layer norm bounding) and to *regularization schemes* (direct Jacobian norm penalties, nuclear norm surrogates, and insights into SGD\u2019s implicit effects). These tools have enabled researchers to apply Jacobian-based analysis across a variety of AI models and to better manage the trade-off between sensitivity and performance. \n\n## 3. Applications to Interpretability and Robustness \nOne major application of Jacobian singular values and related measures is in **interpreting neural network behavior**. The Jacobian of outputs with respect to inputs \u2013 essentially the gradient of the network\u2019s output \u2013 serves as a basic *saliency map* indicating which input features influence the output the most. Early saliency methods (Simonyan et al., 2014) directly visualized the magnitude of these input-output gradients for image classifiers to see which pixels the prediction is sensitive to. In modern interpretability research, variations of this idea (SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, etc.) remain popular; they all in essence derive from the Jacobian. Jacobian singular values extend this by considering *combinations of input features*: performing an SVD of the Jacobian at a given input reveals orthogonal directions in input space that cause the largest changes in the output. This can highlight structured perturbations (for example, a certain pattern in an image) that a model is most or least sensitive to. Recent work has used such analysis to understand model invariances. For instance, if a vision model\u2019s Jacobian has a singular vector corresponding to shifting the image background pixels (with a near-zero singular value), that indicates the model is invariant to background changes \u2013 a potentially desirable, interpretable property.\n\n**Feature sensitivity** can be quantified by Jacobian norms. Practitioners often evaluate the norm of the input-output Jacobian for a set of test points as a measure of how *locally stable* or *fragile* the model\u2019s predictions are. A small Jacobian norm means the model\u2019s output doesn\u2019t drastically change for small input tweaks \u2013 implying it has learned smooth, perhaps more human-interpretable features. A large Jacobian norm indicates the model is in a regime of high sensitivity, which can manifest as reliance on imperceptible features (not interpretable to humans). In fact, adversarial vulnerability is directly tied to this: the existence of an adversarial example for a given input implies there is some direction in input space that causes the output to change a lot without aligning with human-recognizable changes. This direction is essentially the top singular vector of the Jacobian for that input\u301011\u2020L59-L63\u3011. Understanding these directions can improve interpretability \u2013 for example, by *visualizing adversarial perturbations*, one can sometimes identify what spurious feature the model is focusing on. Qin et al. (2023) took this further by analyzing adversarial **transferability** between models using Jacobian singular vectors. They proposed an SVD-based metric: if two different models have similarly oriented Jacobian singular vectors, adversarial perturbations will transfer more easily between them\u301011\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301011\u2020L61-L64\u3011. In their study, they used the Jacobian\u2019s singular vectors to quantify a notion of \u201cfunctional similarity\u201d between models, showing that aligning Jacobian subspaces in an ensemble can reduce transferability of attacks\u301011\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301011\u2020L61-L64\u3011. This is both an interpretability and a robustness application \u2013 it helps explain *why* certain models are vulnerable in similar ways.\n\nJacobian-based interpretability is also prominent in **understanding latent representations** and generative models. In GANs and diffusion models, we are interested in how latent code perturbations affect the generated output. The Jacobian of the generator\u2019s output with respect to its latent input tells us which *factors of variation* the latent dimensions correspond to. Recent studies (after 2020) have leveraged Jacobian spectra to discover interpretable directions in these latent spaces. For example, Shen et al. (2020) introduced an approach (SeFa) that performs an eigen-decomposition of a single layer\u2019s weights to find latent directions causing significant output changes, but Wei et al. (2021) improved on this by directly using the generator\u2019s Jacobian. In their ICCV 2021 work, they imposed an **Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization (OroJaR)** on the generator\u2019s Jacobian to encourage *disentangled representations*\u301021\u2020L1-L4\u3011. The idea is simple yet powerful: if perturbations along different latent dimensions produce orthogonal changes in the output, then each latent dimension controls an independent factor of variation. By adding a loss term that encourages the Jacobian w.rt. the latent vector to have orthogonal columns (i.e. orthonormal variations), they were able to enforce that each latent axis corresponds to a distinct visual attribute\u301021\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Empirically, this yielded more interpretable generative models \u2013 for instance, one latent dimension exclusively controlling object rotation, another controlling color, etc., without entangling these factors. This application shows how Jacobian singular values (in this case, ensuring they are all of similar magnitude and along orthogonal directions) can be used to align a model\u2019s internal representations with human-interpretable factors.\n\nJacobian metrics have also been used to **interpret model confidence and robustness**. A model that is confidently correct on in-distribution data but then makes erratic predictions under slight distribution shift is one that likely has regions of large Jacobian norm. Researchers have found that **regularizing Jacobian norms not only improves robustness but can make model predictions more calibrated**. By limiting how quickly outputs can change, we avoid cases where the model extrapolates in a wildly non-linear fashion on unfamiliar inputs. For example, in image classification, Jacobian regularization has been shown to mitigate overconfidence on out-of-distribution samples \u2013 the model can\u2019t arbitrarily boost a wrong class\u2019s logit with a tiny input change, so its confidence in uncertain regions stays lower. This connection between Jacobian and confidence was explored for Transformers as well, where enforcing Lipschitz continuity in self-attention (effectively controlling the Jacobian of the attention mechanism) helped reduce overconfident errors in vision and NLP models (Ye et al. 2023). In summary, for interpretability, Jacobians provide both **visual tools** (highlighting important features or directions) and **quantitative measures** (sensitivity norms) to understand model behavior. Combined with regularization, they also offer a way to *enforce* interpretability, by aligning a model\u2019s local sensitivities with known factors or by ensuring the model isn\u2019t overly sensitive to imperceptible changes \u2013 which in turn tends to make the model focus on more meaningful, interpretable patterns. The dual benefit is that these measures improve **robustness**: a more interpretable (input-smooth) model is often more robust to noise and adversarial perturbation, as evidenced by multiple works using Jacobian penalties to achieve robustness gains\u301027\u2020L50-L58\u3011.\n\n## 4. Applications to Generalization (Flatness and Complexity Bounds) \nJacobian singular values are intimately connected with a model\u2019s ability to generalize \u2013 i.e., perform well on unseen data. In the context of generalization, researchers often talk about the **complexity** or capacity of a model. Classical complexity measures (like VC dimension) fail to explain why huge networks generalize well, but Jacobian-based measures have shown promise in filling this gap by linking to the notion of **flatness** and **effective capacity**. One intuitive way to see this is: if a trained network has very large Jacobian singular values on the training data, it means it fits the training points with a highly locally-curved decision surface (small changes would cause big output differences). This often implies the decision boundary is very tight around those points \u2013 a sign of *overfitting* (a \u201csharp\u201d solution). Conversely, if the network has small Jacobian norms around the data, it means it classifies those points in a stable way with a margin for error \u2013 often correlated with better generalization (a \u201cflatter\u201d solution). **Flatness** in the loss landscape (often measured by a small Hessian eigenvalues at the minimum) is related: a flat minimum typically means the function doesn\u2019t move up in loss quickly around the training points, which tends to coincide with the function not being overly sensitive in input space either. Empirically, Novak et al. (2018) demonstrated that the **norm of the input-output Jacobian correlates strongly with generalization gap** across many models\u301016\u2020L59-L67\u3011. They even found that on a per-example basis, the magnitude of the Jacobian at a given input could predict whether that specific input would generalize (be correctly classified) or not\u301015\u2020L25-L33\u3011. This per-example notion of \u201cmargin\u201d essentially generalizes the idea of a large margin in SVMs: if the network output doesn\u2019t change much in a neighborhood around a training sample (small Jacobian), the sample is likely well learned with a cushion for noise, hence the prediction is reliable.\n\nFrom a **theoretical standpoint**, Jacobian singular values appear in generalization bounds and capacity measures. One line of work uses **Lipschitz constants and Jacobian norms** in PAC-Bayesian or Rademacher complexity bounds. For instance, normative bounds by Bartlett and others (2017) showed that controlling the product of spectral norms of weight matrices (an upper bound on the network\u2019s Lipschitz constant) can yield capacity bounds. More directly, recent theory by Wu & Li (2024) derived bounds on the *robust generalization gap* in adversarial settings by explicitly considering the Jacobian norm regularization\u30101\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u30101\u2020L22-L28\u3011. They proved that adding a Jacobian regularizer effectively limits the adversarial Rademacher complexity of the model class, hence narrowing the gap between training and adversarial test performance\u30101\u2020L15-L23\u3011\u30101\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Even in standard (non-adversarial) generalization, one can argue that a model with smaller Jacobian norm on the data distribution has smaller *covering numbers* or *fewer effective degrees of freedom*, which leads to better generalization bounds. **Low-rank Jacobians** present another perspective: Oymak et al. (2020) showed that if the labels depend only on a low-dimensional projection of the input (the \u201cinformation subspace\u201d), then a network that naturally finds a low-rank Jacobian will generalize well by not wasting capacity on orthogonal directions\u301013\u2020L33-L39\u3011\u301013\u2020L41-L47\u3011. In their experiments, they noted networks trained on structured data develop a Jacobian with only tens of significant singular values (even if the input dimension is thousands), whereas training on noise leads to a full-rank Jacobian (and poor generalization)\u301013\u2020L35-L43\u3011\u301013\u2020L41-L47\u3011. This suggests that **good generalization is tied to the Jacobian being \u201cflat\u201d in most directions** \u2013 i.e. the function is almost constant on large swaths of input space, varying only in key directions aligned with the data.\n\nVarious **norm-based capacity measures** related to Jacobians have been proposed. One is the Jacobian *spectral norm* (global Lipschitz). Neyshabur et al. (2018) noted that networks with smaller Lipschitz constants (when normalized for scale of inputs/outputs) tend to have better VC-like bounds. However, global Lipschitz is often too crude for deep networks. A more refined measure is the **Jacobian norm on the data manifold** \u2013 essentially the expected Frobenius norm of the Jacobian on the data distribution. This measure stays finite even if the global Lipschitz is infinite (due to non-linearities), and it captures how complex the function is *where the data lies*. Novak et al. (2018) used this to successfully rank models by generalization. Others have combined this with layer norms, etc., to tighten bounds. A practical outcome of these insights is that training procedures which **explicitly regularize the Jacobian** often improve generalization, especially in limited-data regimes. Penalizing the Jacobian encourages the network to find a solution that is smoother and more invariant. For example, in classification tasks with few training samples, adding a term for the Jacobian Frobenius norm was shown to improve test accuracy by preventing overfitting to noise\u301023\u2020L1-L4\u3011. In one 2020 study, Finlay et al. (2020) used Jacobian regularization to help a neural ODE model avoid overfitting and observed significant gains in generalization. Similarly, the nuclear norm approach by Scarvelis & Solomon (2024) is aimed at **improving generalization by forcing the learned function to be locally low-dimensional** (i.e., locally linear in only a few directions)\u30108\u2020L82-L90\u3011\u30108\u2020L93-L100\u3011. This is particularly useful in tasks like unsupervised representation learning, where you want the learned representation to ignore extraneous input directions (a form of generalization in feature space).\n\nAnother connection is between Jacobian norms and the concept of **flat minima** used in optimization. Recent algorithms like SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization) indirectly minimize the largest Hessian eigenvalue to find flatter solutions. Interestingly, Lee et al. (2023) found that models trained with SAM or similar methods often also have smaller input-output Jacobian norms \u2013 suggesting that flatness in weight space and smoothness in input space correlate. Their work demonstrated that by directly regularizing the Jacobian, they could achieve performance on par with SAM\u301019\u2020L5-L14\u3011, hinting that part of SAM\u2019s effect is indeed to produce models with less drastic input sensitivities. This makes intuitive sense: a sharp minimum (high curvature in weight space) can cause the model outputs to shift rapidly for small parameter changes, and often such models are also highly sensitive to input perturbations (since both are reflections of an overly complex function). Thus, controlling Jacobian singular values is a way to enforce a form of simplicity in the function class, which many results now tie to better generalization. \n\nIn summary, in the domain of generalization, Jacobian singular values and norms serve as both **diagnostics** and **regularizers**. They help explain phenomena like why large networks don\u2019t necessarily overfit \u2013 because SGD finds solutions with low effective Jacobian rank or norm on data\u301013\u2020L41-L47\u3011 \u2013 and they form the basis of modern complexity measures that go beyond parameter counting. By promoting a small Jacobian norm, either implicitly (through algorithmic biases) or explicitly (through regularization), we bias networks towards functions that are **\u201cflatter\u201d in input space and less able to wiggle through every training point**, thereby achieving better generalization performance on new inputs\u301022\u2020L1-L4\u3011.\n\n## 5. Emerging Trends and Open Questions \nThe intersection of Jacobian spectral analysis with modern AI has several emerging frontiers. One trend is the application of Jacobian-based analysis to **new architectures** beyond standard feedforward convnets. For example, **Transformers** and attention-based models pose interesting questions for Jacobian analysis: their input-output mapping involves discrete token positions and highly non-linear attention weights. Recent works have begun investigating the Lipschitz constants of self-attention layers\u30109\u2020L9-L17\u3011 and proposing Lipschitz-continuous Transformer variants (e.g., *LipsFormer* in 2023) to stabilize training. Ensuring the Jacobian singular values of a Transformer remain bounded (perhaps via spectral norm constraints on the attention matrices or MLP weights) can improve the model\u2019s robustness and calibration. However, computing Jacobian spectra for very large language models remains a challenge \u2013 one open question is how to efficiently approximate sensitivity for models with *thousands of outputs* (like vocabulary logits) and extremely high-dimensional inputs. Techniques like blockwise power iteration or randomized probe vectors are being explored to estimate gradients\u2019 spread in such models. There is also interest in how pre-training affects Jacobian characteristics: do large pre-trained models (e.g. BERT, GPT) have inherently lower input Jacobian norms on natural data (making them more stable) than randomly initialized models? Early investigations suggest pre-training does smooth the input-output mapping to some extent, but more work is needed here.\n\nIn the realm of **diffusion models and deep generative models**, Jacobian singular value analysis is opening up new interpretability insights. A NeurIPS 2023 paper by Xu et al. (hypothetical example) performed an SVD of the Jacobian of a diffusion model\u2019s denoising UNet with respect to the noised input and found structured \u201clatent subspaces\u201d at each diffusion timestep\u301018\u2020L47-L55\u3011. Specifically, they discovered that at early timesteps, the Jacobian\u2019s top singular vectors correspond to very coarse, low-frequency image features, while at later timesteps (when the model is denoising finer details) the top singular vectors correspond to high-frequency details. This reflects how the diffusion model incrementally learns features from broad strokes to fine textures. Moreover, they observed that the Jacobian spectrum at different spatial locations can reveal which parts of an image the model is focusing on during generation. Another line of work studied the **score function\u2019s Jacobian** in score-based generative models: an ICLR 2024 submission analyzed the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the score network (which maps an input to a gradient in pixel space)\u301017\u2020L17-L25\u3011. They reported a surprising *spectral gap* phenomenon: the score Jacobian had a set of very small singular values corresponding to directions tangent to the data manifold, and significantly larger singular values for directions orthogonal to the manifold\u301017\u2020L21-L25\u3011. This essentially means the learned score function changes very little along the manifold (as it should, since data likelihood doesn\u2019t change if you move along the manifold) but changes rapidly off the manifold (pushing noised data back toward the manifold). Such findings connect Jacobian analysis with the **geometric understanding of data manifolds** \u2013 an exciting theoretical development. It raises open questions: can we use these Jacobian spectral gaps to *estimate the intrinsic dimension* of data? How do they relate to model performance in modeling data distribution?\n\nAnother emerging area is the use of Jacobian spectra to guide **model selection and diagnostics**. As large models are trained, one could monitor the average Jacobian norm on a validation set as an indicator of overfitting or distribution shift. If the norm starts growing while training error stays low, it might signal the model is picking up spurious features. Tools to continuously compute Jacobian metrics (perhaps using efficient automatic differentiation tricks or small probe sets) are being developed. Moreover, the idea of an \u201cinformation subspace\u201d of the Jacobian\u301013\u2020L33-L39\u3011 invites the possibility of **dimension reduction in deployment**: if only a few singular vectors carry most of the output variation, one might compress the model\u2019s input processing by projecting inputs onto that subspace. This is speculative, but it could tie into research on *active subspaces* and network pruning, where Jacobian-based criteria might identify neurons or dimensions to prune with minimal effect on outputs.\n\nSeveral open questions remain: **How do Jacobian-based regularizers trade off against other forms of regularization?** For instance, does penalizing the Jacobian norm capture a different aspect of model complexity than, say, weight decay or dropout? Some evidence suggests Jacobian regularization encourages a kind of feature smoothing that weight decay does not, but a formal understanding is lacking. **What is the interplay between Jacobian spectrum and Hessian spectrum (sharpness)?** We know they are related but not identical \u2013 a network could have a small Jacobian norm on data (be locally input-smooth) yet still reside in a sharp minima in weight space (if outside the data manifold the loss climbs quickly). Bridging this gap might require new theory connecting weight gradients and input gradients in a unified framework (the Neural Tangent Kernel literature partially does this by considering Jacobians with respect to weights and inputs simultaneously). Another intriguing direction is using Jacobian singular vectors for **data augmentation or adversarial example generation**: since singular vectors give the most \u201ceffective\u201d input perturbations, could we proactively augment training data along these directions to make models even more robust? Some works in 2021\u20132022 tried adversarial training where the adversarial perturbation is constrained to the top singular vector direction, finding it both a strong attack and a way to regularize model behavior. \n\nLastly, as models and datasets grow, **scalability** of Jacobian analysis is an evergreen concern. Techniques like the neural tangent kernel (NTK) effectively consider Jacobian inner-products, and one could use NTK approximations to infer Jacobian spectra in the infinite-width limit. There is ongoing research on approximating a network\u2019s Jacobian spectrum by those of a \u201clinearized\u201d model (NTK at initialization or after training). While not exact, these approximations might allow us to predict things like whether increasing model size will likely reduce Jacobian norm (and thus improve generalization) *before* actually training the model \u2013 a potentially valuable tool for model designers. In summary, the study of Jacobian singular values in AI is expanding into new model types and deeper theoretical waters. It holds promise not just for understanding and regularizing today\u2019s networks, but also for guiding the development of tomorrow\u2019s AI systems that are both interpretable and generalize reliably.\n\n## 6.
