That is a **degeneracy inside the neutral subspace**, not an error\u2014the CLVs are defined only up to mixing inside equal\u2011exponent blocks.\n* If you quotient the dynamics by SE\u00a0(2) (slice or moving\u2011frame reduction), the three symmetry CLVs disappear and only \\(F(a)\\) survives as the single neutral direction, exactly as it should for the symmetry\u2011reduced system.\n\nSo, without assuming any special solution such as a rigid soliton, the four zero\u2011exponent CLVs are simply the **tangent vectors generated by the flow and by the three infinitesimal Euclidean motions acting on the current field configuration**."

The result is that GS vectors may have components in both the unstable and neutral subspaces as part of the orthogonalization process. Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), on the other hand, properly separate invariant subspaces without the overlap found in Gram-Schmidt vectors.

Exactly the same geometry holds in high dimension: unless you pick a metric that *specifically* makes \\(E^{c}\\) orthogonal to its complement, every CLV\u2014positive, neutral, or negative\u2014will have some Euclidean projection onto each symmetry generator.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2003Why the Gram\u2013Schmidt test and the CLV test look different\n\n| test | vectors you examined | what orthogonality is enforced on |\n|------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Gram\u2013Schmidt (\u201cbackward\u201d Lyapunov vectors)** | the re\u2011orthonormalised QR columns | mutual orthogonality of **the *current* backward vectors themselves** |\n| **CLVs** | the covariant basis \\(c_i(a)\\) | no orthogonality requirement at all |\n\nBecause the four zero exponents are degenerate, both algorithms are free to rotate the neutral block arbitrarily from one re\u2011orthonormalisation step to the next.  With CLVs that rotational freedom is exercised *after* the backward\u2013forward sweep, so you end up with a basis that is covariant but generically oblique to the symmetry directions.\n\n---\n\n### 4\u2003What would make the overlaps vanish?\n\nOnly two special situations:\n\n1. **You explicitly orthogonalise to the centre bundle** after you have the CLVs.  \n   Form \\(P_c\\), the *Euclidean* projector onto the span of the four neutral CLVs, and subtract it:  \n   \\(\\tilde c_i = (\\mathbb 1-P_c)c_i\\).  The \\(\\tilde c_i\\) still span the stable bundle, but now are orthogonal (by construction) to every symmetry generator.\n2. **You work in symmetry\u2011reduced coordinates (a slice / moving frame)**.  \n   There the symmetry directions are removed from the state space altogether, so all remaining CLVs are automatically orthogonal to them.\n\nEither approach is legitimate if orthogonality to the group directions is what you need for further analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 5\u2003Take\u2011away\n\n* All CLVs **belong** to their proper Oseledets subspace, but they are **not supposed to be orthogonal** to the symmetry generators in the Euclidean metric you used for the dot products.  \n* Non\u2011zero overlaps with \\(\\partial_x a,\\partial_y a,(x\\partial_y-y\\partial_x)a,\\dot a\\) are therefore expected for **every** CLV except those four that form the neutral block itself.  \n* To make the overlaps exactly zero you must either (i) project the CLVs off the centre bundle or (ii) compute the exponents in a symmetry\u2011reduced space.\n\nSo your results are entirely consistent with theory; the apparent \u201cleakage\u201d into symmetry directions is just a consequence of working with an oblique (non\u2011orthogonal) invariant splitting."

              "A\u2011ha\u2014that clears up the mystery.  \nNothing in the theory says the *canonical* symmetry generators are mutually orthogonal in the inner product you use; they are only guaranteed to be **linearly independent**. In fact, for a generic field \\(a(x,y)\\)\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\partial_x a,\\; \\partial_y a\\rangle_{L^2}\n      = \\iint (\\partial_x a)(\\partial_y a)\\;dx\\,dy\n\\]\n\nis **not** zero unless the pattern has some special separability or symmetry.  \nSo\n\n* \\(\\{\\partial_x a,\\partial_y a,(x\\partial_y-y\\partial_x)a,\\dot a\\}\\) is a perfectly good *basis* of the centre bundle \\(E^{c}(a)\\),  \n* but it is an *oblique* basis: the Gram matrix \\(G_{ij}=\\langle g_i,g_j\\rangle\\) is full.\n\n---\n\n### What that means for the GS vectors\n\n1. **Orthogonality is to the *span*, not to each basis vector separately**  \n   When `gs[0]` and `gs[1]` are made orthogonal to the four zero\u2011GS vectors, they become orthogonal to *every* vector in \\(E^{c}\\).  Because the \\(g_i\\)\u2019s lie inside \\(E^{c}\\), their dot products with `gs[0/1]` are forced to be zero as well:\n\n   \\[\n     \\langle \\text{gs[0]}, g_i\\rangle\n     \\;=\\;\n     0 ,\\qquad\n     i=1,\\dots,4 .\n   \\]\n\n   If you still measure small but non\u2011zero values, they should be at round\u2011off level (\u00a0\u2248\u00a010\\(^{-12}\\) in double precision). Anything larger indicates that the diagnostic inner product is not identical to the one used in the QR step.\n\n2. **Non\u2011orthogonal generators explain the earlier \u201cleakage\u201d**  \n   Before you checked the rank you were projecting each GS vector onto *individual* generators and found non\u2011zero overlaps. Because the generators are themselves oblique, a vector can be orthogonal to their **span** yet have a finite dot product with each generator taken separately. A simple 2\u2011D cartoon illustrates it:\n\n   ```\n        g2\n        ^\n        |\n        |     u  (orthogonal to span{g1,g2})\n        |\n        +------>\n             g1\n   ```\n   The vector \\(u\\) is perpendicular to the *plane* spanned by \\(g_1,g_2\\), but its inner product with both \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) is non\u2011zero when \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are not themselves orthogonal.\n\n---\n\n### How to make diagnostics clearer\n\n* **Build an orthonormal basis of \\(E^{c}\\)** once and for all, e.g.\n\n  ```python\n  G = np.stack([dx, dy, rot, dt], axis=1)   # shape: (Ngrid, 4)\n  Qc, _ = np.linalg.qr(G)                   # 4 orthonormal columns\n  ```\n  Then use the columns of `Qc` for all projections.  With this basis you will see\n  ```python\n  np.abs(Qc.T @ gs[0]).max()   # \u2248 machine\u2011zero\n  np.abs(Qc.T @ gs[1]).max()   # \u2248 machine\u2011zero\n  ```\n\n* **Check consistency of inner products**.  Make sure the QR routine and your diagnostic use exactly the same weighting (domain size, dealiasing, Fourier vs. real\u2011space normalisation, etc.).  Even a tiny mismatch breaks orthogonality at the 10\\(^{-6}\\)\u201310\\(^{-8}\\) level.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n* The symmetry\u2011plus\u2011time generators form an oblique basis; \\(\\langle\\partial_x a,\\partial_y a\\rangle\\neq0\\) is normal.  \n* Orthogonality of the first two GS vectors to the **span** of that basis is all the theory promises\u2014and that is what your rank\u20114 test confirmed.  \n* Converting the generators to an *orthonormal* set (or projecting with the QR metric itself) will remove the apparent \u201cleakage\u201d you observed.\n\nSo your data are consistent with expectations; the only missing piece was recognising that the canonical generators are not orthogonal under the metric you are using."

              "### What \u201cinner product\u201d does your QR routine use?\n\nThe *only* thing that matters is the bilinear form that the **orthonormalisation step actually calls when it projects one column onto another**.  If you did not code a custom dot product, every off\u2011the\u2011shelf routine\u2014`numpy.linalg.qr`, your own Gram\u2013Schmidt written with `np.vdot`, LAPACK\u2019s `dgeqrf`, etc.\u2014defaults to the plain Euclidean inner product on **the raw state vector**\n\n\\[\n\\langle u,v\\rangle_{\\mathrm{QR}}\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\sum_{n=1}^{N} u_n^{*}\\,v_n ,\n\\]\ni.e. `np.vdot(u, v)` (or `np.dot(u, v)` for real data).\n\nSo, unless you *explicitly* multiplied the state by a weight or mass matrix **inside** the Gram\u2013Schmidt loops, your QR orthonormalises with respect to\n\n* **no grid\u2011spacing factors** (`\u0394x\u0394y`),  \n* **no dealiasing weights**,  \n* **no Fourier\u2010to\u2010physical scaling**,  \n* **no Jacobian determinants.**\n\n(It is perfectly legal to work with that \u201craw\u201d norm; the Oseledets splitting is metric\u2011independent.  You just have to be consistent.)\n\n---\n\n### Why your tensor\u2011dot diagnostic can differ\n\n```python\n# your diagnostic\n(np.tensordot(weight * u, v, axes=u.ndim))\n```\n\nIf `weight` is anything other than `1`, you are comparing *different* inner products:\n\n* **QR step**\u00a0 used\u2003\\(\\sum_n u_n^{*} v_n\\)\n* **Diagnostic** used\u2003\\(\\sum_n w_n\\,u_n^{*} v_n\\)\n\nEven a uniform grid spacing factor (`dx*dy`) changes the numbers enough that an exact zero in the QR norm shows up as an \\(\\mathscr O(dx\\,dy)\\) \u201csignificant\u201d value in the weighted norm.\n\n---\n\n### How to make the two match\n\n1. **Use the same dot product everywhere**\n\n   ```python\n   def dotQR(u, v):\n       return np.vdot(u, v)          # complex\u2011conjugate dot\n\n   # projections in your diagnostic\n   proj_dx = dotQR(dx, gs[0])\n   ```\n\n2. **Or, build a *weighted* QR** so it matches your preferred physical norm.\n\n   *Factor the weight matrix \\(W=\\operatorname{diag}(\\sqrt{w_n})\\).*\n   Orthogonalise the *scaled* vectors \\(\\tilde v = W\\,v\\):\n\n   ```python\n   vtilde = np.sqrt(weight) * v              # apply once at load time\n   Q, R = np.linalg.qr(Vtilde)               # numpy now uses the weighted norm\n   ```\n   Then diagnostic dot products must of course use that *same* weight.\n\n---\n\n### Quick consistency test\n\n```python\n# dot product that QR actually used\ndef dotQR(u, v):\n    return np.vdot(u, v)          # or np.dot for real data\n\n# check orthogonality of first two GS vectors to the neutral block\nerr = max(abs(dotQR(gs[k], gs[j]))\n          for k in (0,1)          # \u03bb1, \u03bb2\n          for j in range(2,6))    # the four \u03bb\u22480 vectors\nprint(f\"max |<gs[0/1], neutral>| in QR norm: {err:.3e}\")\n```\n\n* `err \u2272 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2` \u2003\u2192 all is well: they are orthogonal in the QR norm.  \n* `err \u2273 10\u207b\u2076`\u2003\u2192 the backward iteration has not converged or you used extended precision in a few places.  \n* Small in QR norm but **large in your weighted norm**\u2003\u2192 nothing is wrong; it is just a different metric.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n* **QR inner product** is whatever scalar\u2011product you code *inside* the Gram\u2013Schmidt loops; default libraries use the plain Euclidean one.  \n* Measure orthogonality with **that same inner product**; otherwise \u201csignificant\u201d dot products are just artefacts of mixing metrics."

              "# Numerical Methods for Lyapunov Exponents in PDEs \u2013 A Literature Review\n\n## Introduction: Chaos in Partial Differential Equations  \nUnderstanding chaos in **partial differential equations (PDEs)** requires quantifying how infinitesimal perturbations grow or decay in an infinite-dimensional phase space. **Lyapunov exponents (LEs)** provide this quantification, measuring the average exponential divergence rate of nearby trajectories\u301047\u2020L105-L112\u3011. A **positive Lyapunov exponent** signals sensitive dependence on initial conditions \u2013 the hallmark of chaos. For finite-dimensional ODEs, algorithms for computing LEs (e.g. the Benettin\u2013Wolf method with periodic Gram\u2013Schmidt reorthonormalization\u30105\u2020L290-L297\u3011) are well-established. In PDEs, one conceptually has infinitely many LEs, but in practice the system is truncated to a finite-dimensional approximation (e.g. via spectral or finite-difference discretization). The challenge is that high-dimensional systems strain computational resources and numerical stability, especially when we seek not just the largest LE but the **full Lyapunov spectrum** of many exponents. \n\nA major advance in tackling high-dimensional chaotic systems came in 2007. *Ginelli et al.* introduced a robust algorithm to compute **covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs)** alongside LEs\u301050\u2020L98-L105\u3011. Unlike the orthonormal tangent vectors from the standard Gram\u2013Schmidt procedure, CLVs are *intrinsic* directions associated with each Lyapunov exponent, remaining covariant with the dynamics. This development made it *practically feasible* to extract detailed geometric information (like stable/unstable manifolds and degree of hyperbolicity) from chaotic PDE simulations\u301050\u2020L98-L105\u3011. In parallel, *Wolfe & Samelson (2007)* proposed a similar method in a fluid dynamics context\u301039\u2020L52-L60\u3011. These algorithms addressed the longstanding difficulty that naive tangent-space evolution will align with the fastest-growing direction, obscuring subdominant exponents. By periodically orthonormalizing (to get converged exponents) and then **back-solving** to recover CLVs, one can obtain all Lyapunov exponents *and* the corresponding perturbation directions\u301039\u2020L52-L60\u3011. Subsequent works (e.g. *Kuptsov & Parlitz 2012*) refined the approach and clarified the theory, introducing notions like **adjoint CLVs** and improved numerical stability\u301039\u2020L53-L61\u3011\u301039\u2020L63-L65\u3011. In summary, by the late 2000s researchers had the tools to **compute Lyapunov spectra in high-dimensional systems** \u2013 opening the door to comprehensive chaos analysis in PDEs.\n\n## Numerical Approaches and Algorithms  \n**Gram\u2013Schmidt / QR Methods:** The traditional approach to compute LEs is to evolve an initial orthonormal basis of perturbation fields along with the PDE and periodically re-orthonormalize them\u30105\u2020L290-L297\u3011. This yields the so-called *Lyapunov spectrum* $\\{\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\dots,\\lambda_N\\}$, ordered from largest to smallest. Algorithmically, one integrates the **tangent linear PDE** (the linearized equations for perturbations) alongside the nonlinear PDE, and at fixed time intervals performs a QR decomposition (or Gram\u2013Schmidt orthonormalization) on the perturbation vectors\u30105\u2020L290-L297\u3011. The growth factors obtained before each renormalization, when averaged in time, give the LEs. This \u201cclassical\u201d method was originally developed for ODE systems\u30105\u2020L290-L297\u3011 and has been successfully applied to discretized PDEs. For example, the computation by *Edson et al. (2019)* of LEs for the 1D Kuramoto\u2013Sivashinsky PDE explicitly follows this approach (see their Algorithm 1)\u30105\u2020L290-L298\u3011. They note that periodic reorthonormalization prevents all perturbation vectors from aligning with the most unstable direction, thus allowing subdominant exponents to be measured\u30105\u2020L293-L301\u3011. Modern implementations leverage parallel computing and efficient linear algebra to handle state vectors with $10^5$\u2013$10^6$ degrees of freedom. The Gram\u2013Schmidt method provides the Lyapunov spectrum and is especially useful for calculating scalar diagnostics like the **Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension** (an estimate of fractal attractor dimension)\u301028\u2020L13-L21\u3011. However, the orthonormal perturbation vectors it produces at each step do *not* correspond to true solution perturbations \u2013 they are continually reorthogonalized mixtures.\n\n**Covariant Lyapunov Vector (CLV) Method:** The CLV approach computes perturbation vectors that *covary* with the flow, yielding the actual directions of growth/decay in phase space\u301050\u2020L98-L105\u3011. It involves a two-pass algorithm: a forward integration with periodic QR orthonormalization to obtain Lyapunov exponents, followed by a backward integration that projects out the covariant directions\u301039\u2020L52-L60\u3011. The result is a set of Lyapunov vectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{v}^{(i)}(t)\\}$ at each time, each growing or decaying with rate $\\lambda_i$. *Ginelli et al. (2007)* demonstrated that for **spatially extended systems**, these covariant vectors often have different **localization properties** and spatial Fourier spectra than the orthonormal (Gram\u2013Schmidt) vectors\u301050\u2020L98-L105\u3011. In other words, CLVs can pick out physically meaningful patterns (e.g. localized defects, coherent structures) associated with each exponent, whereas the QR vectors tend to be delocalized due to artificial orthogonalization. The ability to compute CLVs has been crucial for assessing **hyperbolicity** in chaotic PDE solutions. One can check the angles between stable and unstable subspaces along a trajectory \u2013 nonzero angles indicate a hyperbolic (structurally stable) chaos, whereas frequent small angles signal departures from hyperbolicity. This was exactly the analysis performed by *Inubushi et al. (2012)* on a 2D Navier\u2013Stokes flow (discussed below) using Ginelli\u2019s method\u301016\u2020L108-L115\u3011. Improvements to the CLV algorithm (e.g. those described by *Kuptsov & Parlitz 2012*) have enhanced numerical accuracy and introduced diagnostics like checking the norm-independence of CLV angles\u301039\u2020L55-L64\u3011 for hyperbolicity tests. In practice, CLV computations are more memory- and CPU-intensive, since one must store intermediate state or Jacobian information during the forward run to later reconstruct vectors in the backward pass. Nonetheless, they have become a standard tool in recent studies of high-dimensional chaos.\n\n**Finite-Time and Local Exponents:** In some applications (especially fluid dynamics), one is interested in how instability rates vary in space or time. Variants of Lyapunov analysis, such as **finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs)** and **local Lyapunov exponents**, are used to study transient growth and spatial distribution of chaos. For example, in turbulent flows one can compute the instantaneous growth rate of perturbations to identify where in the domain chaos is being actively produced\u301047\u2020L113-L117\u3011. These analyses typically piggyback on the same numerical framework described above, but instead of long-time averages, they examine short-time stretching rates or the spatial structure of perturbation fields. The CLVs are particularly useful here \u2013 one can project them onto physical space to visualize perturbation \u201cenergy\u201d localized in certain regions or modes\u301016\u2020L108-L115\u3011\u301047\u2020L113-L117\u3011. Some studies also consider **tangent-space dimensions** associated with different phenomena (e.g. decomposition into subspaces of CLVs related to fluid vs. thermal modes in a climate model\u301035\u2020L21-L29\u3011). In summary, today\u2019s numerical methods allow not only computation of Lyapunov spectra as numbers, but also a **decomposition of the chaos** into characteristic directions, timescales, and spatial patterns \u2013 greatly enriching our understanding of PDE dynamics.\n\n## Applications in Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence  \n**Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard Convection (RBC):** One of the first large-scale applications of Lyapunov analysis in PDEs was to Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection, a fluid layer heated from below. Turbulent convection can exhibit **spatiotemporal chaos** known as spiral-defect chaos. *Karimi and Paul (2012)* carried out an extensive computation of the Lyapunov spectrum for RBC in a cylindrical container\u301021\u2020L85-L93\u3011. By using a parallelized algorithm (evolving the Boussinesq equations and tangent equations on a supercomputer), they were able to capture on the order of 50 Lyapunov exponents for a moderately large domain\u301021\u2020L85-L93\u3011. Their results showed a positive Lyapunov spectrum with roughly 8\u201310 strongly positive exponents and many weakly positive ones, yielding a Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension around 50\u301021\u2020L85-L93\u3011. This was, at the time, the **highest-dimensional chaotic attractor** quantitatively characterized by Lyapunov diagnostics under experimentally relevant conditions\u301021\u2020L85-L93\u3011. Notably, they confirmed that RBC chaos is **extensive**: the attractor dimension grows with system size, meaning each addition of space essentially adds a similar number of active degrees of freedom (consistent with earlier observations by Egolf and others). In fact, the dimension was found to increase roughly linearly with the convective domain\u2019s horizontal area, indicating that distant regions act quasi-independently\u301021\u2020L85-L93\u3011. Such analysis provides a quantitative measure of \u201chow many degrees of freedom\u201d a turbulent convective flow effectively has \u2013 information that is invaluable for model reduction and theoretical descriptions.\n\n**Navier\u2013Stokes Flows (Kolmogorov and Wall Turbulence):** The computation of Lyapunov spectra in fluid turbulence is extremely challenging due to the large number of active scales. However, progress can be made in simplified or small-scale scenarios. *Inubushi, Takehiro, & Yamada (2012)* applied covariant Lyapunov analysis to a **2D Kolmogorov flow** (a sinusoidally forced shear flow, which is a prototypical doubly-periodic Navier\u2013Stokes flow)\u301016\u2020L102-L111\u3011. By tracking CLVs, they examined the **hyperbolicity** of the chaotic attractor. They found that at low Reynolds numbers the attractor behaved as a uniformly hyperbolic chaotic system (stable and unstable manifolds meeting at finite angles), but beyond a certain $Re$, smaller angles between stable and unstable directions began to appear\u301016\u2020L108-L115\u3011. At higher $Re$ the attractor clearly **violates hyperbolicity**, as indicated by nearly tangential invariant subspaces\u301016\u2020L108-L115\u3011. Interestingly, they correlated the loss of hyperbolicity with flow properties: as $Re$ increases, the fluid\u2019s vorticity field develops longer temporal correlations and the energy dissipation becomes more intermittent, in tandem with the CLV subspace angles shrinking\u301016\u2020L108-L115\u3011. This study showcased how CLVs can reveal subtle dynamical changes in a fluid system that are not evident from gross flow statistics alone \u2013 essentially probing *how* chaotic instability is organized in the flow\u2019s state space.\n\nA more complex application was done by *Inubushi et al. (2015)* for **3D wall-bounded turbulence**. They considered a \u201cminimal flow unit\u201d of plane Couette flow (shear flow between moving plates) \u2013 a small domain that sustains near-wall turbulence \u2013 and investigated the well-known **regeneration cycle** of near-wall streaks and vortices\u301017\u2020L99-L107\u3011. Using covariant Lyapunov vectors, they were able to decompose the turbulent trajectory into phases and identify which perturbation modes are unstable in each phase\u301017\u2020L101-L107\u3011. In one phase of the cycle, corresponding to the breakdown of streaks, they found significant positive local Lyapunov exponents associated with **sinuous streak instabilities and streamwise vortices** (the characteristic structures that regenerate turbulence)\u301017\u2020L101-L107\u3011. In the other phase (between bursts), all Lyapunov exponents turned non-positive, indicating a quiescent period with no growing perturbation \u2013 essentially the turbulence temporarily \u201crides on\u201d decaying modes\u301017\u2020L103-L107\u3011. By linking CLVs to physical flow structures (sinuous modes, vortices, etc.), this work provided a **mechanistic picture of turbulence sustainment**: the chaotic orbit wanders such that it repeatedly enters a state unstable to streak/vortex instabilities (causing a burst of chaos) and then returns to a calmer state until those instabilities build up again\u301017\u2020L101-L108\u3011. This is a clear example of how Lyapunov analysis in PDEs can connect phase-space dynamics to real-space flow features. It also underscores the practicality of the covariant method \u2013 in a high-dimensional turbulence system, one can pinpoint which directions in state space correspond to known fluid-dynamical instabilities.\n\n**Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence:** In contrast to the above small-domain studies, *Mohan, Fitzsimmons, & Moser (2017)* tackled Lyapunov analysis in fully developed 3D turbulence (forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence) at varying Reynolds numbers\u301047\u2020L109-L117\u3011. They focused on the **leading Lyapunov exponent** (largest $\\lambda_1$) as a measure of the chaotic \u201cpredictability horizon\u201d in turbulence\u301046\u2020L105-L112\u3011. By conducting direct numerical simulations of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations on periodic cubes, augmented with a tangent integration for perturbations, they estimated $\\lambda_1$ for different Reynolds numbers. A key finding was that $\\lambda_1$ **grows with $Re$ faster than the inverse Kolmogorov time scale**\u301047\u2020L109-L117\u3011. The Kolmogorov time ($\\tau_\\eta$) is the characteristic turnover time of the smallest eddies (dissipation scale) in turbulence; many had assumed the fastest chaos would be tied to these smallest scales. Instead, Mohan et al. found the chaos grows even more quickly, hinting that **instabilities at sub-Kolmogorov scales** (or collective effects of many small eddies) drive the divergence\u301047\u2020L109-L117\u3011. By examining the perturbation fields (the Lyapunov vector) at each instant, they confirmed that the perturbations are concentrated in the **fine-scale vorticity structures** and that numerous \u201cspots\u201d of local growth exist simultaneously throughout the fluid\u301047\u2020L113-L117\u3011. Essentially, turbulence doesn\u2019t have a single Achilles heel for perturbations \u2013 it\u2019s unstable in many places at once, and as $Re$ increases these sources of instability proliferate and intensify. These results are important for turbulence theory (indicating, for example, that predicting turbulence may be even harder than one might guess from Kolmogorov scaling) and demonstrate that even in the extremely high-dimensional regime of 3D turbulence, targeted Lyapunov computations (here, of just $\\lambda_1$) are feasible and insightful\u301047\u2020L109-L117\u3011. We note that calculating the *full* Lyapunov spectrum in such a system remains out of reach, but even partial spectra or specific exponents can yield valuable information about chaotic dynamics in fluids.\n\n## Applications in Reaction\u2013Diffusion and Pattern-Forming Systems  \nMany pattern-forming PDEs \u2013 such as reaction\u2013diffusion equations, phase-field models, or the Kuramoto\u2013Sivashinsky (KS) equation \u2013 exhibit spatiotemporal chaos, making them fertile ground for Lyapunov analysis. A classic example is the **Kuramoto\u2013Sivashinsky equation**, a fourth-order nonlinear PDE that models processes like flame fronts and thin-film dynamics and is well-known for chaotic solutions in 1D. *Edson et al. (2019)* performed a systematic computation of Lyapunov spectra for the KS equation with varying domain size\u301028\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Using a pseudo-spectral discretization and Gram\u2013Schmidt tangent integration, they extracted dozens of Lyapunov exponents for domains up to length $L=100$ (with periodic or odd-periodic boundary conditions). Their results beautifully confirmed the **extensive chaos** hypothesis for KS: the number of positive Lyapunov exponents grows roughly linearly with the domain length\u301028\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Equivalently, the **Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension** of the attractor (an upper bound on its fractal dimension) increases linearly with $L$\u301028\u2020L19-L27\u3011. This linear scaling had been conjectured and observed in earlier studies with rigid boundaries (e.g. by Manneville and by Tajima & Greenside) \u2013 Edson et al.\u2019s high-precision calculations for periodic boundaries showed the same qualitative behavior\u301028\u2020L19-L27\u3011. In practical terms, each additional unit length of the domain adds about one new positive exponent (and a corresponding negative exponent), indicating that distant subdomains contribute independently to chaos. Their largest-domain simulation ($L=100$) had on the order of ~20\u201325 positive Lyapunov exponents\u301028\u2020L31-L35\u3011, implying a high-dimensional chaotic attractor. Besides the spectra, they also computed Lyapunov vectors to examine patterns: for instance, the leading Lyapunov vector in KS typically corresponds to a localized high-gradient \u201cburst\u201d moving through the domain, whereas higher-index vectors correspond to secondary structures. These detailed studies of KS not only benchmark numerical methods against an equation that is relatively simple to simulate, but also provide insight into how **turbulence in a 1D system** builds up as the system size grows.\n\n**Chemical Reaction\u2013Diffusion Chaos:** In chemical systems with activator-inhibitor dynamics and diffusion, one can observe complex chaotic patterns (e.g. moving spots, oscillatory Turing patterns). An interesting study by *Glyzin & Shokin (2016)* explored a reaction\u2013diffusion PDE in an unusual **\u201cdumbbell\u201d domain** \u2013 two wide regions connected by a narrow bridge \u2013 to examine how geometry triggers chaos\u301049\u2020L45-L53\u3011. By varying the bridge width, they effectively tuned the degree of spatial coupling between the two regions without changing the overall domain size\u301049\u2020L43-L51\u3011. For a wide bridge (almost two rectangular domains merged), the system\u2019s behavior was a simple periodic oscillation (no chaos)\u301049\u2020L45-L53\u3011. But as the bridge was narrowed, that periodic state lost stability and gave way to a **spatially inhomogeneous chaotic attractor**\u301049\u2020L49-L57\u3011. Glyzin & Shokin computed the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension of this attractor as a function of the bridge width\u301049\u2020L47-L55\u3011. They found that the dimension of the chaotic attractor **increased** as the bridge became narrower (indicating more complex dynamics), but eventually the dimension saturated to a finite value even as the bridge kept shrinking\u301049\u2020L51-L57\u3011. In other words, the chaos intensifies with the geometric constraint up to a point, beyond which the system cannot populate any higher-dimensional chaotic behavior. They attributed this saturation to the finite number of spatial modes that can fit into the narrow bridge region \u2013 effectively a cutoff in the possible pattern complexity\u301049\u2020L53-L57\u3011. Moreover, they noted that the growth in Lyapunov dimension correlates with an increasingly complex spatial distribution of the system\u2019s *stable* equilibria or cycles as the geometry changes\u301049\u2020L53-L57\u3011. This study is a good example of using Lyapunov spectra to characterize a **bifurcation to spatiotemporal chaos** and to quantify how \u201chigh-dimensional\u201d the chaos is. It also highlights an applied math perspective: invariant measures (like Lyapunov dimension) can serve as diagnostic tools when studying how system parameters (here, domain shape) affect chaotic dynamics\u301049\u2020L45-L53\u3011.\n\n**Optical Pattern Formation (Kerr Comb Chaos):** Nonlinear optical cavities can often be described by PDEs (such as the Lugiato\u2013Lefever equation, which is basically a driven-damped nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation). These systems can display rich spatiotemporal behavior, including chaos. *Liu et al. (2017)* reported on chaotic dynamics in Kerr optical frequency combs and fiber cavities, using Lyapunov analysis to characterize the regimes\u301048\u2020L385-L393\u3011. They numerically integrated the mean-field cavity equation (with Kerr nonlinearity and forcing) and calculated the **full Lyapunov spectrum** for certain parameter sets\u301048\u2020L385-L393\u3011. By doing this across a sweep of the laser pump parameter, they constructed a **bifurcation diagram** where the **Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension** was used as an order parameter to identify chaotic vs. non-chaotic regimes\u301048\u2020L387-L395\u3011. In particular, they identified a wide range of pump intensities where the system exhibits **coexisting attractors**: a spatiotemporal chaotic state, an oscillatory localized structure (soliton), and a homogeneous steady state all exist simultaneously\u301048\u2020L389-L397\u3011. The Lyapunov spectra helped confirm the nature of each attractor \u2013 the chaotic state had multiple positive exponents (high KY dimension), the oscillatory localized state had a Lyapunov spectrum indicating a limit cycle (one zero exponent, the rest negative), and the homogeneous state was stable (all negative exponents)\u301048\u2020L385-L393\u3011. Moreover, by analyzing how the chaotic state is born, they found that an oscillatory localized pattern destabilizes via radiation of counter-propagating fronts that invade the homogeneous background, leading to a patchy chaotic pattern\u301048\u2020L391-L399\u3011. The **front propagation speed** was measured and related to Lyapunov exponents as well. This study demonstrated the practical use of Lyapunov computations in **nonlinear optics**: by mapping out where LEs become positive, one can chart phase diagrams of operation for optical devices (in this case, distinguishing stable comb generation from chaotic comb regimes). It is a nice crossover of physics and applied math \u2013 using dynamical systems tools to inform photonics technology.\n\n## Applications in Climate and Geophysical Models  \nBeyond classical fluid mechanics and chemistry, Lyapunov methods have penetrated into geophysical and climate modeling, which often involve PDEs or PDE-derived systems. A fully realistic climate model has enormous dimensionality, but researchers examine reduced models to gain insight into instability and predictability. A noteworthy example is the study by *Vannitsem & Lucarini (2016)*, who computed Lyapunov exponents and vectors for a **coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean model**\u301035\u2020L15-L24\u3011\u301035\u2020L21-L29\u3011. This model was derived by heavy truncation of the quasi-geostrophic equations (keeping 36 modes total), so it still retains a flavor of PDE dynamics (with multiple spatial scales), but is low-dimensional enough to handle with CLV algorithms\u301035\u2020L17-L25\u3011. The Lyapunov spectrum of this model had a mix of positive, zero, and negative exponents: specifically 2 positive, 18 near-zero, and 16 negative LEs in their chaotic regime\u301035\u2020L21-L29\u3011. The large number of **near-zero exponents** reflects the model\u2019s **multiscale nature** \u2013 there are slow, long-term modes especially in the ocean component that neither grow nor decay fast\u301035\u2020L23-L29\u3011. These quasi-neutral directions led to very **degenerate CLVs** that were hard to distinguish, underscoring a fundamental issue in multiscale chaotic systems: the presence of extended neutral manifolds related to slow dynamics\u301035\u2020L23-L30\u3011. Despite this, the tangent subspaces associated with the strongly chaotic (positive/negative) part of the spectrum were well-behaved, allowing Vannitsem & Lucarini to construct statistical laws for finite-time Lyapunov exponents and study error growth\u301035\u2020L27-L34\u3011. Physically, they could identify two distinct classes of coupled modes in the neutral manifold \u2013 essentially characterizing how atmospheric and oceanic perturbations intermingle in the coupled system\u301035\u2020L25-L33\u3011. Their work suggests that classical hyperbolicity is outright broken in such systems (the chaos is non-hyperbolic due to many zero exponents), and they discuss how this complicates the use of predictability concepts like Lyapunov times in climate dynamics\u301035\u2020L23-L31\u3011. Nonetheless, this kind of CLV analysis is guiding the development of data assimilation and ensemble forecasting methods. For example, knowing the spectrum of LEs allows one to identify a **\u201cforecast shadowing subspace\u201d** \u2013 the subspace spanned by the leading Lyapunov vectors, which is where forecast errors grow. This links to earlier work in numerical weather prediction, where breeding vectors and singular vectors (precursors to CLVs) were used to capture the fastest-growing disturbances. Now with CLVs, one can directly analyze the unstable subspace of a climate model\u2019s attractor. The study by Vannitsem & Lucarini is a demonstration that even for high-dimensional, multi-physics PDE models, computing Lyapunov exponents is **practically achievable** and yields deep insights into the error dynamics and stability properties of the system\u301035\u2020L15-L24\u3011\u301035\u2020L21-L29\u3011.\n\n## Summary and Outlook  \nIn the years since Ginelli et al.\u2019s 2007 paper, there has been an impressive breadth of applications of Lyapunov analysis to \u201cgenuine\u201d PDEs across physics and applied mathematics. Table 1 (below) summarizes key examples from the literature, highlighting the diversity of systems and the numerical methods used. A clear pattern emerges: studies of **spatiotemporal chaos in extended systems** routinely find that **Lyapunov spectra** and their associated vectors are indispensable for characterizing the chaotic dynamics. From fluids to optics to chemical reactions, researchers have leveraged these tools to determine the **dimension of strange attractors**, to identify the **mechanisms of instability**, and to test theoretical ideas like extensivity and hyperbolicity. Importantly, these works underscore practical considerations as well \u2013 for instance, the need for parallel computations for high-dimensional spectra, or the handling of near-neutral modes in multi-scale systems.\n\nMoving forward, we can expect numerical Lyapunov analysis in PDEs to become even more commonplace. Continued improvements in algorithms (e.g. more efficient adjoint integrations, block iterative schemes, or leveraging sparsity in Jacobians) and ever-growing computer power will push the envelope of what is achievable. This will enable tackling **turbulence at higher Reynolds numbers**, larger pattern-forming systems, and perhaps certain **quantum field theory lattice models** (though our focus here has been on classical PDEs). There is also a trend toward data-driven approaches \u2013 for example, methods to estimate Lyapunov exponents from observational data or machine-learning surrogates of PDEs. Such approaches (some inspired by the *quasi-diagonal* methods of Carretero et al. 2000, or more recent covariance algorithms) could extend Lyapunov analysis to experimental time series of spatially extended systems, where one doesn\u2019t have direct equations.\n\nIn conclusion, the period post-2007 has seen **Lyapunov analysis mature into a practical, widely-applied toolkit for PDEs**. It allows scientists to rigorously quantify chaos in complex spatiotemporal systems and to connect abstract dynamical indicators to concrete physical phenomena. As summarized in Table 1, a range of scientific domains \u2013 from fluid turbulence and climate dynamics to optical physics and chemical pattern formation \u2013 have benefited from this capability. The continued development of numerical methods for Lyapunov exponents and vectors stands as an important enabler for discovering and understanding high-dimensional chaos in the natural world.\n\n## Table 1: Key Studies on Lyapunov Exponents in PDEs (post-2007)  \n\n| **Reference (Year)**                   | **PDE/System**                                 | **Lyapunov Method**             | **Application Domain**      | **Key Findings/Contributions**                                    |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Ginelli et al.\u301050\u2020L98-L105\u3011 (2007)** | General ODE/PDE (e.g. coupled map lattice)     | Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLV) algorithm  | Dynamical systems (chaos theory) | Introduced a general method to compute CLVs for any chaotic system.

Provided quantitative values for Lyapunov exponents and attractor dimensions up to $L=100$. Established a clear link between system size and chaos degree for this canonical PDE. |\n\nEach of the works above contributed to our practical understanding of chaotic PDEs, either by **advancing numerical methodology** or by **applying Lyapunov analysis to unveil new physics**. Collectively, they show that today we can tackle Lyapunov exponent calculations in systems ranging from simple 1D pattern formers to realistic 3D turbulent flows. The numerical methods \u2013 particularly the covariant Lyapunov vector approach \u2013 have proven their worth by yielding insights into hyperbolicity, instability mechanisms, and dimensionality of chaos that would be hard to obtain by other means. This literature also illustrates how different scientific disciplines have embraced these techniques: fluid dynamicists quantify turbulence via LEs, while optical physicists and chemists map out chaotic regimes in their systems, and climate scientists examine predictability with them. As computational capabilities grow, we expect even more ambitious studies (e.g. higher-Reynolds turbulence or higher-resolution climate models) to become feasible, further bridging the gap between theoretical dynamical systems and real-world spatiotemporal chaos.\n\n"

In view of the great interest in covariant Lyapunov vectors and their wide range of potential applications, in this article we summarize the available information related to Lyapunov vectors and provide a detailed explanation of both the theoretical basics and numerical algorithms. We introduce the notion of adjoint covariant Lyapunov vectors. The angles between these vectors and the original covariant vectors are norm-independent and can be considered as characteristic numbers. Moreover, we present and study in detail an improved approach for computing covariant Lyapunov vectors. Also we describe, how one can test for hyperbolicity",

We identify a wide regime of parameters where the system exhibits a coexistence between the spatiotemporal chaos, the oscillatory localized structure, and the homogeneous steady state.

To characterize better the spatiotemporal chaos, we estimate the front speed as a function of the pump intensity.",

The bridge width is a bifurcation parameter of the\r\nproblem and is changed in such way that the measure of the domain is preserved. The conditions on\r\nchaotic oscillations emergence have been studied and the dependence of invariant characteristics of\r\nthe attractor on the bridge width has been constructed. The diffusion parameter has been chosen such\r\nthat, in the case of widest possible bridge (corresponding to a rectangular domain), the spatially homo\u0002geneous cycle of the problem is orbitally asymptotically stable. By decreasing the bridge width, the\r\nhomogeneous cycle loses stability; then, a spatially inhomogeneous chaotic attractor emerges. For the\r\nobtained attractor, we have calculated the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension and\r\nobserved that the dimension grows as the parameter decreases, but is bounded. We have shown that\r\nthe dimension growth is connected with the growing complexity of the distribution of stable solutions\r\nwith respect to the space variable.\r\nKeywords: diffusion chaos, attractor, Lyapunov dimension, Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation, bifurcation\r\nDOI: 10.3103/S0146411616070075\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nBoundary problems of the reaction\u2013diffusion type represent an important example for studying the\r\nformation of spatially irregular inhomogeneous structures in spatially homogeneous media. This phe\u0002nomenon was described mathematically for the first time by Alan Turing in [1], which is devoted to the\r\ndiffusive instability of spatially homogeneous solutions. The Turing\u2013Prigozhin theorem [2] describes a\r\nsituation when, at certain change in the diffusion parameter of the system, a spatially homogeneous\r\nregime loses its stability and spatially inhomogeneous regimes appear in its neighborhood. The corre\u0002sponding facts can be easily proved in the case of simple domains, such as a segment or convex domains\r\nwith smooth boundaries. This work is devoted to the problem of the loss of stability of spatially homoge\u0002neous cycle of the distributed dynamic system of the reaction\u2013diffusion type in the case when its bound\u0002ary changes while the measuring function is maintained. In particular, the case of a dumbbell-shaped\r\ndomain has been considered in detail. The boundary problems of a parabolic type in this definition\r\ndomain were considered previously in abstracts by Jose Arrieta [4, 5], as well as in a number of his later\r\npublications with coauthors [6\u20138]. However, these works raised a somewhat different problem that con\u0002cludes in researching the situation when the width of the bridge that connects the domains tends to zero.\r\nIn order to select the parameters of the problem, some additional assumptions were made more con\u0002sciously. First, for simplicity, the definition domain of spatial variable was selected in the form of two rect\u0002angular parts interconnected by a bridge. The width of the bridge was accepted by the bifurcation param\u0002eter of the problem so that its maximal value corresponded to the initial rectangular domain. Then, it was\r\nassumed that the parameters of the point system (independent on spatial variable) are located near the\r\nAndronov\u2013Hopf bifurcation and that the problem has a spatially homogeneous cycle. The next assump\u0002tion concludes in the fact that a diffusive loss of stability of homogeneous cycle is possible and the diffu\u0002sion parameter for the mentioned rectangular domain is selected to be close to, but not greater than the\r\nvalue of the diffusion parameter.",

One of the main results obtained here is the fact that the increase in the\r\nLyapunov dimension of attractor is tightly connected with the complication of spatial distribution of\r\nattractor. In other words, in a more complicated case, there is a more irregular distribution profile of the\r\nvariables among the spatial domain.\r\n1.

RESULTS OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS\r\n3.1.Difference Model for Analyzing the Ginzburg\u2013Landau Equation\r\nWe will use difference approximations by spatial variables for numeric estimation of boundary problem\r\n(10). Let us build a difference model which approximates (10). For this, we will place the origin of coor\u0002dinates to the lower left corner of domain , then split it into rectangles of sizes not greater than ,\r\nwhere Then, we will count points with coordinates ,\r\n, , as grid nodes. Let us derive a system of ordinary differen\u0002tial equations for points instead of boundary problem (10) by replacing the Laplasian operator\r\nwith its difference analogue\r\n(18)\r\nwhere and set of indexes Ind is defined as\r\n(19)\r\nBoundary conditions of impenetrability are simulated in the standard way; i.e., on the outer boundary of\r\nthe domain , we assume that\r\n(20)\r\nOn the bridge boundary and on boundaries of rectangles adjacent to it, boundary conditions can be\r\napproximated similarly to (20) using the fact that the boundary does not pass by the middle of the distance\r\nbetween the node points. We will solve the obtained system of ordinary differential equations using the\r\nDormand\u2013Prince methods 8(5) (see [10]).\r\n3.2. Algorithm for Computing Lyapunov Exponents \r\nand Lyapunov Dimensions of the Boundary Problem\r\nThe behavior of solutions of system (18) becomes complicated very rapidly with a decrease in the bridge\r\nwidth; thus, there is a need to calculate some invariant characteristics of the problem attractor that defines\r\nits chaotic nature. The algorithm for defining the spectrum of the Lyapunov exponents and dimensions is\r\nbased on the well-known multiplicative ergodic Oseledec theorem [11] according to which, for a finite\u0002dimensional system, the magnitude of the major factor does not depend on the initial point on the attrac\u0002tor (to be more exact, it is identical for almost all initial values by some invariant measure). In our case,\r\ninfinite-dimensional problem (10) is replaced by the finite-dimensional system of ordinary differential\r\nequations (18) and, in general, their Lyapunov exponents may be mismatched. Accordingly, the issue of\r\nthe adequacy of model (18) is of separate interest.\r\nWe will compute Lyapunov exponents of system (18) using the Benettin method [12, 13] (more precisely,\r\nits variation described in [14]). For this purpose, one should first pick up the attractor of the set, which con\u0002cludes with solving (18) with the initial conditions from the attraction pool during about 1000 periods\r\n( ) of the spatially homogeneous regime (11).

The result is considered to be appropriate if the difference between the obtained estimates is\r\nsmall. Unfortunately, the time interval for the system to get on the attractor, as well as the duration\r\nrequired to calculate the Lyapunov exponents are experimental magnitudes and should be additionally\r\nchecked using other methods.\r\nThe obtained Lyapunov exponents allow estimating Lyapunov dimension of attractor of problem (21).\r\nAssuming that estimates l = 1, \u2026, K were obtained at the previous step and their magnitudes are enu\u0002merated in descending order to let us introduce Lyapunov dimension using the formula (see Kaplan,\r\nYorke [24])\r\n(24)\r\nwhere integer j is selected by the rule\r\n, \u2212, +, , , \u2212 , + ,\r\n, ,, , ,\r\n\u03b8 \u03b8 +\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 \u03b8 +\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 \u239b \u239e\r\n=\u03bd \u2212 + \u239c \u239f \u03c4 \u239d \u23a0 \u03b4 \u03b4\r\n\u2217 \u2217 +\u03b8 \u2212 + \u03b7 + \u03b8 , , \u2208 , \u03b8 \u03b7\r\n11 11\r\n1 2 2\r\n2\r\n2 2\r\n(1 )\r\n(1 )(2 ) ( )\r\nij i j i j ij ij ij ij\r\nij ij ij i j i j\r\nd\r\nic\r\nd x y\r\nic i j Ind\r\n2 \u03c0 c2\r\n\u03bb = \u03b8 , =, , (1) ( ) 1 ln ( ) 1 l\r\nl T l \u2026K\r\nT\r\nT c = \u03c02 2 \u03b8( )( ) l T l \u03b8 , ,\r\n( )( ) l\r\ni j T ( ) i j Ind , \u2208 \u22c5\r\n,\r\n, \u2208\r\n\u03b8 = \u03b8 \u03b4\u03b4.\r\n\u03a9 \u2211 2 () ()\r\n( )\r\n1 () () l l\r\ni j\r\ni j Ind\r\nT T xy\r\nmes\r\n\u03bbl\r\n\u03b8( )( ) l T\r\n\u03bb( ) k\r\nl\r\n\u03bb ,l\r\n+ =\r\n= + \u03bb, \u03bb \u2211\r\n1 1\r\n1\r\nj\r\nL l\r\nj l\r\nd j\r\nFig. 2.

Given the closeness of curves 2a and 2b, it makes sense to consider\r\nthe spatial distribution of the solution amplitude of system (21) , at the same value of\r\n. It can be seen in Fig. 9a that the regime formed in this situation is spatially inhomogeneous.\r\nThe value is the next critical since at oscillatory regimes established in system (21)\r\nbecome disordered. At values close to (see Figs. 3a, 3b plotted for and ) oscil\u0002latory regime is such that, during long time ranges, the values at different points in the domain are syn\u0002chronized; this leads to the fact that the condensation of trajectories is observed near a bisector of the first\r\ncoordinate angle in mentioned figures.\r\nA further decreasing in leads to the complication of oscillatory regimes (see Figs. 4\u20136). The degree\r\nof their complexity is reflected in dependencies on of major Lyapunov factor and Lyapunov dimen\u0002sion built for an attractor of system (21). It can be seen (see Figs. 7, 8) that, after appearing at \r\nin a system of chaotic attractor magnitude oscillates in a relatively narrow range and, after an interval\r\nof to (where it is almost the same), the value grows after .\r\nThe complication of an attractor can be illustrated using diagrams of the spatial distribution of solution\r\namplitude of system (21) at different values of the relative bridge width and fixed value of t. Figures 9 show\r\nmagnitudes , where built in nodes of domain . Evidently, regimes obtained at small \r\n(see Figs. 9c, 9d plotted at and , correspondingly) turn out to be significantly more\r\nirregular than regimes that appear at values of close to critical, at which the spatially homogeneous cycle\r\nloses its stability (see Figs. 9a, 9b plotted at and , correspondingly).\r\n\u03b8 ,\r\n( )( ) l\r\ni j t (( ) ) i j Ind , \u2208\r\n\u03bc\r\n\u03bc= . 0 6 \u03bc< . 0 6\r\n\u03bc= . 0 6 \u03bc= . 0 59 \u03bc= . 0 56\r\n\u03bc\r\n\u03bc \u03bb1\r\ndL \u03bc< . 0 6\r\n\u03bb \u03bc1( )\r\n\u03bc\u2248 . 0 6 \u03bc\u2248 . 0 32 dL( ) \u03bc \u03bc\u2248 . 0 32\r\n\u03b8 ,\r\n( )( ) l\r\ni j t ( ) i j Ind , \u2208 \u03a9 \u03bc\r\n\u03bc= . 0 33 \u03bc= . 0 22\r\n\u03bc\r\n\u03bc= . 0 61 \u03bc= . 0 59\r\nFig. 5.

              "**Short answer**\n\n- **Why a Ginzburg\u2013Landau (GL) equation?**  \n  The authors start from a generic two\u2011component reaction\u2013diffusion system that is *close to an Andronov\u2013Hopf bifurcation* of its spatially\u2011homogeneous limit cycle.  By applying a standard multiple\u2011scales/amplitude expansion and projecting the full PDE onto the critical oscillatory eigenmode, they reduce the dynamics to the *complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau (CGL) equation* (their eq.\u00a010).  The CGL is the universal amplitude equation that governs slow spatio\u2011temporal modulations of an oscillatory state near a Hopf + diffusion (Turing\u2011type) instability, so it contains exactly the physics they need while being much simpler than the full chemistry model.  In their problem the *only* control parameter they keep is the bridge width\u00a0\u03bc that changes the Laplacian spectrum and therefore the diffusive stability of the homogeneous cycle. \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\n- **What Lyapunov exponents do they compute?**  \n  They do **not** compute LEs for the original chemical model; instead they:\n\n  1. Discretise the derived CGL equation (eq.\u00a010) in the \u201cdumb\u2011bell\u2019\u2019 domain with a 200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200 finite\u2011difference grid, obtaining a **large system of ODEs** (eq.\u00a018). \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n  2. Integrate that ODE together with its tangent equations (eq.\u00a021) and apply the Benettin/Gram\u2013Schmidt algorithm to obtain the *largest* K Lyapunov exponents.  These exponents quantify the growth rates of infinitesimal perturbations of the **spatio\u2011temporal CGL field** on that grid. \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201  \n  3. From the partial spectrum they also compute the Kaplan\u2013Yorke (Lyapunov) dimension of the resulting attractor as the bridge width \u03bc is varied.  Hence every data point in Fig.\u00a07 &\u00a08 is an LE (or KY dimension) of the **discrete CGL dynamics**, not of the underlying point\u2011kinetics ODE. \ue200cite\ue202turn0file0\ue201\n\nIn other words, the paper uses the GL equation **as a reduced PDE model** that captures the onset of diffusion\u2011induced chaos when the domain is pinched; and the Lyapunov exponents they report are those of that reduced PDE after spatial discretisation, i.e. of the *field dynamics itself*, not of an auxiliary cloud\u2011of\u2011points ODE."

For a stationary (Turing) instability, small perturbations are governed by a *real* Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation (e.g. the Newell\u2013Whitehead\u2013Segel equation)\u30107\u2020L1374-L1379\u3011\u301030\u2020L214-L220\u3011. In contrast, for an oscillatory (Hopf) instability, the evolution of the complex oscillation amplitude satisfies the *complex* Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation (CGL)\u30107\u2020L1374-L1379\u3011\u301030\u2020L214-L220\u3011. In other words, the CGL arises as the **generic amplitude PDE** describing RD systems near a Hopf bifurcation\u301030\u2020L214-L220\u3011. This was first shown in the early 1970s (e.g. by Stewartson & Stuart 1971) and later by Kuramoto & Tsuzuki (1976) specifically for chemical oscillatory reactions\u301022\u2020L490-L498\u3011. The standard form is, for example: \n\n\\[ \\partial_t A = (1 + i\\,\\alpha)\\,\\nabla^2 A + \\mu\\,A - (1 + i\\,\\beta)\\,|A|^2\\,A, \\] \n\nwith $A(x,t)$ a complex amplitude, and real constants $\\alpha,\\beta,\\mu$ set by the RD system\u2019s parameters\u301016\u2020L147-L155\u3011. Here the imaginary coefficients reflect inherent oscillatory (phase) dynamics. When the system\u2019s bifurcation is non-oscillatory, these imaginary parts drop out (e.g. $\\alpha=\\beta=0$), recovering the real Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation\u301016\u2020L142-L150\u3011\u301030\u2020L214-L220\u3011. \n\n**Validity of the CGL approximation:** It is crucial that this reduction is **asymptotic**, valid only sufficiently close to the bifurcation threshold. Empirical and numerical studies confirm that the CGL quantitatively captures RD dynamics *only* near the Hopf onset; farther from threshold (where nonlinearities are strong), the RD behavior can deviate from the CGL predictions\u30101\u2020L71-L78\u3011. For example, in the oscillatory chlorite\u2013iodide\u2013malonic acid (CIMA) chemical reaction, one finds that spiral-wave patterns obey the CGL description when the system is tuned very near its Hopf bifurcation, but *not* when parameters are far beyond onset\u30101\u2020L71-L78\u3011. In summary, **reaction\u2013diffusion systems can be mathematically mapped to a complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation in the weakly nonlinear regime**, but this is generally an *approximate (leading-order)* equivalence rather than an exact identity.\n\n## Gradient-Flow and Variational Structure (or Lack Thereof)  \nThe term \u201ccomplex gradient flow\u201d refers to dynamics that can be derived from a **variational principle** (gradient descent of some potential functional) in a complex field space.  Most two-component reaction\u2013diffusion systems **do not admit a global potential functional**, i.e. they are *non-variational* systems\u301030\u2020L218-L224\u3011. In physical terms, they do not strictly relax to minimize a free energy; instead they can exhibit sustained oscillations, travelling waves, or chaos. In fact, the **complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation itself has no general Lyapunov (energy) functional** in the typical case\u301030\u2020L218-L224\u3011. This non-variational character is what allows the CGL (and the underlying RD systems) to support rich spatiotemporal behaviors like spirals, phase waves, and turbulence\u301030\u2020L218-L224\u3011, unlike a simple gradient-descent system which would settle to equilibrium.\n\n**Special case \u2013 a potential-based CGL:** There is a notable special parameter regime where the CGL *does* become a gradient flow. If the coefficients satisfy a certain equality (often denoted $b=c$ in normalized form), one can transform to a rotating frame and show that the CGL can be written as $\\partial_t A = - (1+ i b)\\,\\delta \\mathcal{F}/\\delta A^*$ for some real functional $\\mathcal{F}[A]$\u301022\u2020L525-L533\u3011. In this so-called \u201cvariational CGL\u201d case, $\\mathcal{F}$ acts as a **Lyapunov functional**: its value monotonically decreases in time, and the system relaxes to a local minimum of $\\mathcal{F}$\u301022\u2020L531-L539\u3011. Aranson and Kramer note that for $b=c$ the CGL possesses a global Lyapunov (free energy) and all transients decay to steady rotating solutions\u301022\u2020L531-L539\u3011. However, this situation is the *exception*. For generic parameter values (any disparity between $b$ and $c$), no such functional exists and the dynamics are non-potential. Likewise, a generic two-variable RD model (e.g. activator\u2013inhibitor systems like the Brusselator or FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo) cannot be derived from a single scalar potential unless the reaction kinetics fulfill special detailed-balance conditions. In practice, typical RD equations are **non-gradient systems**, which is why they can produce self-organized oscillations and patterns rather than just relaxing to homogeneous steady states\u301030\u2020L218-L224\u3011.\n\n## Extensions to Neural Fields and Phase-Field Models  \nThe mathematical linkage between RD systems and amplitude equations has been extended (conceptually) to other contexts. For example, in **neural field models** of the cortex, researchers have applied a Landau\u2013Ginzburg approach to describe large-scale brain activity. If a spatially extended neural tissue is poised near a Hopf bifurcation (transition to collective oscillations), one can write an amplitude equation for the firing-rate oscillation, often analogous to the CGL equation\u301033\u2020L2-L9\u3011. This has been used to reconcile the coexistence of oscillatory waves and critical-state avalanches in cortical dynamics, by treating the cortex as a system near the edge of a Hopf (oscillatory) and/or another critical point\u301033\u2020L2-L9\u3011. The key point is that the *framework* of RD \u2192 CGL carries over: a complex order-parameter field captures the slow envelope of neural oscillations. However, the underlying equations here are neural population equations (often integro-differential), not literal chemical reaction\u2013diffusion, so this is an *analogy and asymptotic model reduction* rather than an exact equivalence.\n\nIn **phase-field models** of materials science, one also encounters gradient-flow RD equations, albeit of a different nature.  A classic example is the Allen\u2013Cahn equation (a reaction\u2013diffusion PDE for an order parameter), which is in fact the $L^2$ gradient descent of a Ginzburg\u2013Landau free energy functional\u301034\u2020L46-L54\u3011. Such phase-field equations *are* variational: the Allen\u2013Cahn RD equation drives the system toward minimal interface energy (modeling phase separation)\u301034\u2020L46-L54\u3011. This contrasts with the oscillatory CGL case \u2013 the Allen\u2013Cahn (or Cahn\u2013Hilliard) equations involve *real* order parameters and do not produce sustained oscillatory patterns. They fall under **real** gradient flows (dissipative evolution of domains or \u201cphases\u201d) and are often called *model A* or *model B* dynamics in the Hohenberg\u2013Halperin classification. We mention them here to note that **some RD-type equations can be derived from variational principles** \u2013 but those correspond to *stationary pattern formation or phase separation*, not the oscillatory phenomena described by complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau dynamics. In summary, **neural field equations** extend the RD\u2192CGL idea to brain dynamics (with oscillatory instabilities similar to Hopf), while **phase-field models** exemplify RD equations that *are* true gradient flows (though typically involving no complex-valued fields). The two are very different in application and behavior, and should not be conflated.\n\n## Conclusion  \nResearch has firmly established that reaction\u2013diffusion systems near an oscillatory instability can be **approximated** by the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation through weakly nonlinear analysis\u301030\u2020L214-L220\u3011\u30101\u2020L71-L78\u3011. This provides a powerful link between RD dynamics and complex-valued amplitude **descent** (dissipative) equations in that near-threshold regime. However, this link is largely *asymptotic* \u2013 valid in the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation or Turing\u2013Hopf codimension-two point. **No general exact equivalence** has been found that transforms an arbitrary reaction\u2013diffusion system into an identical complex gradient-flow formulation beyond those small-amplitude approximations or special symmetric cases. In particular, the presence of non-variational terms in both typical RD kinetics and the generic CGL equation means there is no single potential function whose gradient exactly generates the full dynamics in both real and imaginary parts\u301030\u2020L218-L224\u3011. Therefore, **aside from the weakly nonlinear (amplitude equation) limit or finely tuned special cases, there is no direct one-to-one mathematical equivalence between generic reaction\u2013diffusion systems and complex gradient flows**.\n\n**Answer:** No, a direct *general* equivalence has not been established (only asymptotic reductions and limited special-case mappings exist, not a universal exact mapping)."

They're proposing a connection between the imaginary part of S and energy injection. But, why hasn't this been explored extensively in the literature? Well, complex RD systems don\u2019t generally form gradient flows since there's no traditional potential. Using a complex functional to represent gradient descent would conflict with physical interpretation and standard mathematical practices (real-valued Lyapunov functionals are preferred)."

When using complex potentials, the dissipative property is lost, and there's no guarantee of monotonic decrease. RD systems are rarely viewed this way because they require complex-valued action functionals that don\u2019t have clear physical meaning. Most literature around gradient flows for RD systems focuses on real-valued functionals, particularly in phase models and entropy analysis, not complex ones. Complex gradient flow is mainly used in specific cases, like CGL or supersymmetric quantum mechanics."

Once \\(S\\) is complex, its real part need not be monotone and one loses the key energy/entropy tool that makes gradient structures so valuable.\n\n2. **Cauchy\u2011Riemann constraint.**  \n   Writing the reaction terms as \\(\\partial_{z^*}F(u,v)\\) enforces holomorphicity conditions that only a minority of mass\u2011action kinetics satisfy.  Generic reaction polynomials violate those conditions, so a single complex potential \\(F\\) cannot be found.\n\n3. **Positivity of concentrations.**  \n   Physical concentrations are non\u2011negative reals.  Bundling them into a single complex field introduces no advantage for analysis (maximum principles, entropy methods, comparison theorems) and obscures positivity.\n\n4. **Lack of monotone functional = limited payoff.**  \n   Mathematicians study RD attractors, stability, and bifurcations through *real* Lyapunov functions, semigroup estimates, or entropy methods.  A complex functional that offers no monotonicity and no obvious physical interpretation gives little analytical leverage.\n\n5. **Alternative variational frameworks already exist.**  \n   Modern work puts RD into generalized gradient systems with *vector* energies and dissipations (GENERIC, Onsager\u2011Machlup, Wasserstein gradient flows).  Those approaches keep the variables real and preserve thermodynamic structure without needing a complex formalism.\n\n6. **Historical trajectory.**  \n   The people who cared about oscillatory RD (Kuramoto, Cross & Hohenberg, etc.) naturally arrived at the CGL, but immediately saw that outside the \\(b=c\\) line it is non\u2011variational.  Attention shifted to studying phase turbulence and defect chaos rather than forcing a gradient\u2011flow interpretation.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nYour algebraic packaging of \\((u,v)\\) into one complex field *is* correct as a **formal** rewriting\u00a0\ue200cite\ue202turn1file0\ue201, but because the resulting functional \\(S\\) is complex and lacks an obvious Lyapunov interpretation, the mainstream RD community hasn\u2019t adopted it.  When researchers do want a variational picture, they either\n\n* restrict parameters so a *real* Lyapunov functional exists (e.g. the variational CGL case),\n* or work with entropy/Wasserstein gradient structures that keep all variables real and positive.\n\nHence the absence of prior literature is largely cultural and practical: the complex\u2011gradient formalism offers limited analytical or physical benefit compared with the existing real\u2011gradient or non\u2011variational tools the field already relies on."

              "Not at all\u00a0\u2014\u00a0most of the dynamical\u2011systems and pattern\u2011formation literature *deliberately* leaves the Lyapunov/variational comfort zone.  The classic targets are the **non\u2011variational** regimes where oscillations, travelling waves, defects or turbulence arise (e.g. the generic complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation with \\(b\\neq c\\), the Brusselator far past Hopf, Gray\u2013Scott spot replication, etc.).  There the whole point is that **no real Lyapunov functional exists**: energy is **pumped in and dissipated simultaneously**, so monotonic \u201centropy\u201d techniques do not apply.  Analysts then switch to other tools (spectral theory, inertial manifolds, centre\u2011manifold reductions, numerical Lyapunov spectra, etc.).  \n\n### Why almost nobody writes a generic two\u2011component RD system as a *complex* gradient flow\n\n| Obstacle | Consequence |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Gradient\u2011flow \u2261 monotone real functional** in most mathematical definitions. | A complex functional \\(S[z,z^\\*]\\) offers no monotonic quantity, so it does not help to prove existence, stability, or attractor bounds. |\n| **Holomorphicity constraint** (reaction vector = \\(\\partial_{z^\\*}F\\)). | Generic mass\u2011action kinetics fail it; one must sculpt \\(F\\) carefully, so the trick has limited scope. |\n| **Loss of positivity structure** when \\(z=u+iv\\). | Standard maximum\u2011principle and entropy methods that guarantee \\(u,v\\ge 0\\) are obscured. |\n| **Better alternatives already exist** (GENERIC, Onsager\u2013Machlup, Wasserstein gradient flows). | They keep variables real and give clear thermodynamic meaning, so authors adopt them instead. |\n\n### Has *anyone* done it just to show it can be done?\n\nThere are a handful of **didactic or exploratory notes** (similar in spirit to your own write\u2011up\u00a0\ue200cite\ue202turn1file0\ue201) that package a symmetric RD pair into a single complex field and formally write  \n\\[\n\\partial_t z = -\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta z^\\*}\\;,\n\\]\nwith a complex \\(S\\).  But these tend to be *side\u2011remarks* in lectures on geometric mechanics or as symbolic manipulations in physics notes; they have not seeded a recognised sub\u2011topic or a citation chain.  The absence of follow\u2011up papers suggests the community did not find concrete mileage in the representation.\n\nPut differently:\n\n* **Yes \u2013** a few authors have *observed* that any pair \\((u,v)\\) can be glued into \\(z=u+iv\\) and written as a \u201ccomplex gradient\u201d.  \n* **But \u2013** because \\(S\\) is complex and its real part is *not* a Lyapunov function, it has offered little analytical power, so almost no one pursues it beyond that observation.\n\nSo the literature has **not** confined itself to Lyapunov regimes; it simply uses *other* non\u2011variational techniques for the interesting chaotic/oscillatory cases, and the complex\u2011gradient formalism has remained a curiosity rather than a working tool."

Hence you find stray lecture notes\u2014but not a citation trail\u2014behind the idea.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\nMost experts would nod and say *\u201csure, you can always glue \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) into \\(z\\), write a complex functional, and call it a gradient flow\u2014nothing wrong with the algebra, but it buys you little.\u201d*  In that sense the community **is aware** the construction exists; it just hasn\u2019t found a compelling reason to develop or publish it."

              "Below are **five independent lines of evidence** that strengthen the case for treating **complex\u2011valued gradient flows (CGFs)** as a *unifying language for \u201ccomputation by PDE\u201d*.  Each line ends with a short \u201cwhy this helps\u201d takeaway you could cite in a proposal or introduction.\n\n| # | Existing concept or result | How it fits a CGF viewpoint | Why it supports \u201cCGF as computational model\u201d |\n|---|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **1** | **Liouville / continuity equation\u00a0\u2194\u00a0Hamilton\u2013gradient split**<br>For any ODE \\(\\dot{x}=f(x)\\) the associated phase\u2011space density satisfies the continuity (Liouville) equation.  Write \\(f=\\nabla V+\\mathcal J\\nabla H\\) with a skew operator \\(\\mathcal J\\); bundle the two scalars into **one complex potential** \\(S=H+iV\\) and the continuity PDE becomes \\(\\partial_t\\rho=-\\operatorname{div}\\bigl(\\rho\\,\\nabla_{x^\\*} S\\bigr)\\). | Shows the **same factorisation** you found for RD appears for *every* deterministic dynamical system.  **Conservative part\u00a0\u2192\u00a0imaginary component**, **dissipative part\u00a0\u2192\u00a0real component**. | *Evidence of universality*: if the CGF split is always possible, you can argue that \u201cPDE + complex potential\u201d is a canonical representation of deterministic computation, from few\u2011dimensional ODEs up to field theories. |\n| **2** | **Schr\u00f6dinger\u2011type analog computers and quantum algorithms**<br>The (linear) Schr\u00f6dinger equation is literally a CGF with *purely imaginary* potential; open\u2011quantum\u2011systems add a real part (Lindblad damping \u2248 gradient term). | Quantum computing already performs **unitary + dissipative** processing in this complex\u2011gradient format; optical and BEC analog computers implement Gross\u2013Pitaevskii (nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger = CGL). | *Practical precedent*: hardware that naturally realises CGFs (photonic lattices, exciton\u2011polaritons, BECs) has been shown to perform optimisation, matrix inversion, Ising\u2011machine tasks.  Your framework says \u201cthose are just special CGF solvers.\u201d |\n| **3** | **Energy\u2011Based & Contrastive\u2011Divergence Learning**<br>In machine\u2011learning, networks like Hopfield nets or modern EBMs evolve by \\(\\dot{x}=-\\nabla E(x)+\\text{noise}\\).  Recent work on *complex\u2011valued* neural ODEs lets the imaginary part encode fast oscillatory \u201csearch\u201d while the real part encodes slow descent. | CGF formalism unifies **oscillatory exploration + dissipative convergence** in a single PDE \u2013 exactly what a solver needs to avoid poor local minima. | *Design insight*: suggests building analog or neuromorphic hardware whose state obeys a CGF can carry out *both* global exploration (imag\u00a0part) and gradient descent (real\u00a0part) without switching algorithms. |\n| **4** | **Koopman operator & analytic continuation**<br>The Koopman description turns nonlinear dynamics into linear PDEs on observables.  When observables are taken in the **Hardy space of holomorphic functions**, Koopman\u2019s generator is naturally written as a complex directional derivative (i.e. CGF). | Provides a theoretical bridge: CGF language meshes with modern data\u2011driven system identification (DMD, neural\u2011Koopman). | *Tool\u2011chain compatibility*: analysis or learning methods that already use Koopman or complex\u2011analytic bases slot directly into a CGF\u2011based computing architecture. |\n| **5** | **Helmholtz decomposition for vector fields on\u00a0\u211d\u207f**<br>\\(f=\\nabla\\Phi+\\nabla\\times A\\).  In 2\u2011D the \u201ccurl\u201d term is represented by multiplication with \\(i\\) in complex notation.  Thus any planar flow can be encoded as a gradient of a **complex potential** \\(\\Phi+i\\Psi\\). | CGF generalises this classic fact from fluid mechanics.  Your framework recovers incompressible (Hamiltonian) flow as the pure\u2011imaginary part and damped flow as the real part. | *Didactic clarity*: you can market CGF as *\u201cHelmholtz\u2011decomposition\u2011for\u2011dynamics\u201d* \u2013 instantly familiar to physicists and engineers. |\n\n---\n\n### Additional selling points for a CGF paradigm\n\n1. **Unified numerical solvers** \u2013 Split\u2011step (symplectic\u00a0+\u00a0implicit) or operator\u2011splitting schemes map naturally onto the \u201creal vs. imaginary\u201d decomposition.  \n2. **Control knobs** \u2013 Adjusting the ratio of Re/Im parts lets one dial between exploration (quantum\u2011like) and exploitation (gradient\u2011descent) phases, which is desirable in optimisation and machine\u2011learning hardware.  \n3. **Conformal mapping & complex analysis** \u2013 Rich library of analytic techniques (residue calculus, conformal symmetry, maximum\u2011modulus principles) becomes available to study pattern selection, defect dynamics, or stability in these PDE computers.  \n4. **Physical implementability** \u2013 Many dissipative wave systems (laser cavities, chemical turbulence, optical Kerr combs) are already governed by variants of the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau/Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equations; framing them as CGF turns existing lab setups into candidate \u201cPDE processors.\u201d  \n5. **Thermodynamic bookkeeping** \u2013 Real part of the potential directly gives *dissipation function*, imaginary part gives *stored / circulating energy*; this clean separation may aid in designing energy\u2011efficient analog devices.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nYou now have both **conceptual breadth (items\u00a01\u20115)** and **practical hooks (selling points\u00a01\u20115)** that go beyond \u201cit\u2019s an algebraic trick.\u201d  They show that complex gradient flows naturally capture the dual **dissipative\u00a0+\u00a0oscillatory** character required for rich computation, link up with quantum and wave\u2011based hardware, and plug into modern analytic and learning frameworks.  Those arguments should persuade readers that a CGF perspective is *not* just aesthetic, but a versatile foundation for \u201ccomputation with PDEs.\u201d"

That\u2019s where differential geometry or geometric algebra steps in.\n\nSo the complex formalism you\u2019re exploring is the **2\u2011D face** of the broader \u201cshuffle\u00a0+\u00a0damp\u201d decomposition that GENERIC formalises for any dimension or variable set."

For a Hamiltonian or divergence\u2011free ODE this is straightforward; for an arbitrary dissipative \\(f\\) it may not be possible (or physically meaningful).\n\n* **Energy vs. entropy bookkeeping.**\u00a0The generic split becomes informative only when you *impose* the two degeneracy conditions  \n  \\[\n     L\\,\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta\\rho}=0,\n     \\qquad\n     M\\,\\frac{\\delta H}{\\delta\\rho}=0,\n  \\]  \n  which make sure \\(H\\) is conserved and \\(S\\) is non\u2011decreasing.  The toy embedding above satisfies them trivially because \\(H=0\\).\n\n* **Multiple decompositions.**\u00a0For the same ODE you can invent many different \\((H,S,L,M)\\) quadruples.  GENERIC is a *framework*, not a unique identity.\n\n---\n\n## Take\u2011away\n\n* Every continuity equation derived from a deterministic ODE **can** be cast in the GENERIC \u201cstirring\u00a0+\u00a0smoothing\u201d format.  \n* Whether that split carries useful physics (true energy conservation, genuine entropy growth) depends on how cleverly you choose the functionals and operators.  \n* In two spatial dimensions the split collapses to the \u201ccomplex gradient\u2011flow\u201d picture you have been exploring; in higher dimensions one needs the full geometric\u2011algebra or differential\u2011geometry apparatus to write the antisymmetric (Hamiltonian) part."

The GENERIC **structure conditions** are violated, so the equation is **not** a genuine GENERIC system in the thermodynamic sense.\n\n---\n\n### 3\u2002Verdict  \n\n*The continuity equation for an arbitrary ODE satisfies the full GENERIC conditions **iff** the underlying vector field \\(f\\) itself decomposes into orthogonal Hamiltonian\u00a0+\u00a0gradient parts.*  \nThat is **not true in general**; it holds only for special classes of ODEs (Hamiltonian + friction, Langevin without noise, many fluid models, etc.).  For a generic dissipative vector field the proper Poisson and mobility operators do **not** exist, so no non\u2011trivial conserved \\(H\\) or Lyapunov \\(S\\) can be assigned.\n\nSo GENERIC **is generic as a template**, but **its thermodynamic content applies only to systems whose dynamics already carry the split required by the six mathematical conditions above**."

Helmholtz decomposes a vector field into a gradient (curl-free) and a divergence-free component. However, in GENERIC, the antisymmetric part must define a Poisson operator, which needs the Jacobi identity, skew-symmetry, and degeneracy with the entropy gradient. Not all divergence-free fields come from such a Hamiltonian gradient, meaning some components need additional properties for integrability to work with the Poisson operator."

So complex\u2011gradient and Clifford\u2011gradient are interchangeable only in the plane.  In 3\u2011D you need bivectors, not \\(i\\).\n\n3. **Full GENERIC is a **strict subset** of the Helmholtz split.**  \n   You need the curl part to be **Hamiltonian** (extra algebraic constraints) *and* orthogonal to the dissipative metric.  Hence many ODEs (even in 2\u2011D) fail GENERIC.\n\n4. **Complex gradient adds no automatic physics.**  \n   It is always a legal *re\u2011labelling* (in even dimensions) but conservation or dissipation statements require extra symmetry of the chosen metric/bracket\u2014exactly the same extra work you face in the geometric\u2011gradient setting.\n\nSo:\n\n* **Any** \\(n\\)-dimensional ODE can be turned into a geometric\u2011gradient flow with a suitably cooked\u2011up metric (yes).  \n* A **complex** gradient description is always possible in 2\u2011D (one complex coordinate) and extends to higher even\u2011\\(n\\) by bundling variables into multiple complex numbers, but it\u2019s only a repackaging.  \n* **Neither** representation guarantees Lyapunov monotonicity or conserved quantities; those appear *only* when additional metric / bracket constraints are met\u2014precisely the constraints that define a genuine GENERIC system."

Equation\u00a0(1) can be rewritten as a single complex PDE (your late\u2011night derivation):\n\n  \\[\n  \\partial_t z\n      =\\tfrac{D_u+D_v}{2}\\,\\nabla^{2}z\n       +\\tfrac{D_u-D_v}{2}\\,\\nabla^{2}z^{*}\n       \\;+\\;\\partial_{z^{*}}F(z,z^{*}),\n  \\tag{2}\n  \\]\n\n  with a suitable complex \u201cpotential\u201d \\(F\\).\n\n* **Geometric\u2011gradient (functional\u2011gradient) viewpoint**  \n  Treat the **whole field** \\(z(\\cdot)\\) as one point in an infinite\u2011dimensional state space \\(\\mathcal H\\).  \n  A *geometric gradient flow* is an evolution of the form\n\n  \\[\n  \\partial_t z \\;=\\; -\\,\\mathcal G(z)\\,\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal S}{\\delta z^{*}},\n  \\tag{3}\n  \\]\n\n  where \\(\\mathcal G(z)\\) is a (possibly state\u2011dependent) linear operator acting on field variations and \\(\\mathcal S[z,z^{*}]\\) is a functional.  \n  Your expression (2) realises (3) with a specific\u2014somewhat exotic\u2014\\(\\mathcal G\\) and \\(\\mathcal S\\).  \n  No probability densities enter; we are still describing the **deterministic PDE** itself.\n\n---\n\n### Continuity (Liouville) equations are a *different* layer\n\nIf you now imagine **random initial data** for the fields and ask for the probability **density functional** \\(\\mathcal P_t[z]\\) over the function space \\(\\mathcal H\\), its evolution obeys an **infinite\u2011dimensional Liouville (continuity) equation**.

That representation exists irrespective of any probabilistic continuity equation.\n\n2. **Is the geometric\u2011gradient representation *always* possible?**  \n   *Formally, yes*: for any deterministic evolution you can cook up some operator \\(\\mathcal G\\) and functional \\(\\mathcal S\\) so that (3) matches the PDE.  \n   *But*: unless \\(\\mathcal G\\) is symmetric\u2013positive (or antisymmetric, if you want a conserved quantity) the functional \\(\\mathcal S\\) has **no built\u2011in Lyapunov or Hamiltonian meaning**.  So the representation is always possible algebraically, but it is *thermodynamically* meaningful only in special cases (Allen\u2013Cahn, Cahn\u2013Hilliard, variational CGL line, etc.).\n\n3. **Is a complex\u2011gradient formulation always interchangeable with a geometric one?**  \n   *In 2 internal dimensions (two species)* the complex numbers are isomorphic to the 2\u2011D Clifford algebra, so complex\u2011gradient and geometric\u2011gradient are just two notations for the same thing.  \n   *When the internal state dimension exceeds two* (three species, etc.) you need either multiple complex fields or the full geometric\u2011algebra machinery; at that point \u201ccomplex gradient\u201d is no longer a faithful one\u2011to\u2011one translation of the geometric version.\n\n---\n\n**Rule of thumb**\n\n* **Deterministic RD PDE \u2192** you can *always* wrap it in a (possibly fancy) geometric\u2011gradient cloak; the cloak only guarantees Lyapunov structure if the operator is symmetric\u2011positive.  \n* **Stochastic or distributional viewpoint \u2192** the associated infinite\u2011dimensional continuity equation satisfies the full GENERIC thermodynamic conditions *only when* that same symmetric/antisymmetric split holds pointwise in the underlying deterministic dynamics."

Generic vector fields in function space fail that test.\n\n---\n\n## 1\u00a0\u00a0What \u201cgeometric gradient descent\u201d really asks for  \n\nLet the state be a field \\(u(x,t)\\) in some Hilbert or Banach space\u00a0\\(\\mathcal H\\).  \nWriting the PDE  \n\n\\[\n\\partial_t u = F[u]\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nas a **geometric gradient flow** means exhibiting\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\;\n\\partial_t u \\;=\\; -\\,G(u)\\,\n              \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal S}{\\delta u}\n\\;}\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\nwith  \n\n* a (possibly state\u2013dependent) linear operator \\(G(u):\\mathcal H\\to\\mathcal H\\),  \n* a functional \\(\\mathcal S[u]\\) that is (Fr\u00e9chet) differentiable,  \n* and usually the extra wish that \\(G(u)\\) be **symmetric positive\u2011definite** so that \\(\\dot{\\mathcal S}\\le0\\) (Lyapunov).\n\n### Necessary integrability condition  \n\nDefine  \n\\(w(u):=G(u)^{-1}F[u]\\).  \nEquation\u00a0(2) requires  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal S}{\\delta u} = -\\,w(u).     \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\nFor (3) to hold, **\\(w\\) must be an exact variational derivative**:  \nits \u201ccurl\u2019\u2019 in function space must vanish,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta w}{\\delta u} \\;=\\;\n\\Bigl(\\frac{\\delta w_i}{\\delta u_j}\n      -\\frac{\\delta w_j}{\\delta u_i}\\Bigr) \\;=\\;0,\n\\tag{4}\n\\]\n\nso that a single functional \\(\\mathcal S\\) exists.  \nGenerically \\(F[u]\\) does **not** satisfy (4) for any symmetric positive \\(G\\).  \nHence an arbitrary PDE usually **fails** to admit a Lyapunov\u2011type geometric gradient representation.\n\n*If you drop the symmetry/positivity requirement on \\(G\\), you can always *solve* (2) algebraically by putting the entire dynamics into \\(G\\) and letting \\(\\mathcal S[u]=0\\), but then (2) conveys no analytical information and is regarded as meaningless re\u2011labelling.*\n\n---\n\n## 2\u00a0\u00a0Complex\u2011gradient flow is an even tighter straight\u2011jacket  \n\nWriting  \n\n\\[\n\\partial_t z = -\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal S}{\\delta z^{\\!*}},\n\\qquad  z=u+iv,\n\\tag{5}\n\\]\n\nrequires \\(F[u,v]\\) first to be **pairable into complex form**, and then to satisfy the same integrability test (4) in the complex variables.  That fails for generic two\u2011component PDEs for the same reason it fails in the real case; adding more real variables (three or more species) makes a single complex variable impossible, so one would need several complex fields or higher Clifford numbers, with the corresponding integrability conditions on each.\n\n---\n\n## 3\u00a0\u00a0Examples where the rewrite **does** work  \n\n| PDE class | Why integrability holds |\n|-----------|------------------------|\n| Allen\u2013Cahn, Cahn\u2013Hilliard | RHS is the \\(L^2\\) or \\(H^{-1}\\) gradient of a free\u2011energy functional. |\n| Variational complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau (parameter line \\(b=c\\)) | After rotating frame, RHS is \\(-\\delta\\mathcal F/\\delta z^{\\!*}\\) with real \\(\\mathcal F\\). |\n| Viscous Hamiltonian systems in GENERIC form | Vector field *already* supplied as \\( -M\\nabla S + L\\nabla H\\) with orthogonality, so choosing \\(G=M\\) gives gradient descent of \\(S\\). |\n\nThese are **special**, not generic.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u00a0\u00a0Bottom line  \n\n* To call (1) a **geometric gradient descent** you must be able to integrate \\(G^{-1}F\\) to a functional\u00a0\\(\\mathcal S\\); most PDEs fail that integrability (curl\u2011free) test.  \n* A **complex\u2011gradient** form is just a 2\u2011D (or multi\u2011complex) version of the same requirement and therefore is **not always possible** either.  \n* Geometric and complex formulations coincide **only** when the state space splits naturally into complex pairs **and** the integrability condition holds.\n\nSo the answer to your specific question is **\u201cNo: neither representation is guaranteed for an arbitrary PDE; each is possible only when the vector field already has hidden variational structure.\u201d**"

While probability densities often use Wasserstein gradient flow in the FPK equation, general vector fields may not always support this.

This is the same \u201cintegrability\u201d condition discussed earlier; most \\(f\\) fail it. |\n| **2.\u00a0Can (C) always be written as a *complex gradient flow*  \n\\(\\displaystyle \\partial_t z=-\\,\\delta\\mathcal S/\\delta z^{\\!*}\\) after bundling variables into \\(z\\)?** | **Only in special circumstances.**  One needs: <br>\u2022 the phase\u2011space dimension \\(n\\) to be even (so variables can be paired as complex numbers); <br>\u2022 the real\u2013imaginary split of \\(f\\) to satisfy the same integrability condition in complex form.  <br>Generic \\(f\\) doesn\u2019t meet that, so a single\u2011field complex potential seldom exists. |\n| **3.\u00a0Are the complex\u2011gradient and geometric\u2011gradient representations always interchangeable?** | **Interchangeable *only* when:** (i)\u00a0the state dimension is two (or variables can be grouped into independent 2\u2011D planes), and (ii)\u00a0the integrability/Lyapunov conditions happen to hold in each plane.

Below is an explicit proof in two steps.\n\n---\n\n## 1\u2003Definitions we must respect  \n\n| Notion | Mathematical statement |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| **Helmholtz decomposition** | For smooth\u00a0\\(f:\\mathbb R^{n}\\to\\mathbb R^{n}\\) (rapidly decaying or periodic) we can write  \\(\\displaystyle f = -\\nabla\\Phi \\;+\\; w,\\quad\\nabla\\!\\cdot w = 0.\\) |\n| **Geometric gradient flow** | One asks for **some** (possibly state\u2011dependent) **symmetric positive\u2011definite operator** \\(G(x)\\) and a scalar potential \\(\\Psi(x)\\) such that  \\(\\displaystyle f(x) \\;=\\; -\\,G(x)\\,\\nabla\\Psi(x).\\)  If such \\(G,\\Psi\\) exist then along trajectories  \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dt}\\Psi(x(t)) = -\\,\\nabla\\Psi^{\\!T}G\\nabla\\Psi\\;\\le 0\\) so \\(\\Psi\\) is a Lyapunov functional. |\n\n---\n\n## 2\u2003Counter\u2011example in the plane  \n\nTake the **purely rotational** vector field in\u00a0\\(\\mathbb R^{2}\\)\n\n\\[\nf(x,y) \\;=\\; (-y,\\;x),\n\\tag{A}\n\\]\n\nwhose streamlines are perfect circles.\n\n### 2.1\u00a0\u00a0Helmholtz split exists  \nSet \\(\\Phi\\equiv 0\\).

Equation\u00a0(B) tells us  \n  \\((-y,x)=(0,1)=-G\\nabla\\Psi\\).  Therefore \\(\\nabla\\Psi\\neq0\\) and the left\u2011hand side of (C) is **positive**.\n* Pick the point \\((x,y)=(-1,0)\\).  The left\u2011hand side of (C) becomes **negative**.\n\nThus inequality\u00a0(C) cannot be satisfied for all \\((x,y)\\) unless \\(\\nabla\\Psi\\equiv0\\), which would force \\(f\\equiv0\\), contradicting (A).  \n\n### 2.4\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion  \nThere is **no** symmetric positive\u2011definite \\(G\\) and scalar \\(\\Psi\\) satisfying (B).  \nHence the rotational vector field (A) **admits a Helmholtz split but is **not** a geometric\u2011gradient flow.**\n\n---\n\n## 3\u2003General implication  \n\n*   **Helmholtz** guarantees only  \n    \\(\\displaystyle f = -\\nabla\\Phi + w,\\;\\nabla\\!\\cdot w=0.\\)  \n    The divergence\u2011free piece \\(w\\) may contain vorticity (non\u2011zero curl).  \n*   **Geometric gradient descent** demands the *entire* vector field equal \\(-G\\nabla\\Psi\\) with \\(G\\) symmetric positive; such fields obey the sign rule (C).  Any component with non\u2011zero \u201ccirculation\u201d around closed loops violates that rule.\n\nTherefore, **Helmholtz decomposition is necessary but not sufficient** for a geometric\u2011gradient representation.  The two notions coincide only when the divergence\u2011free (curl\u2011like) part itself can be absorbed into \\(-G\\nabla\\Psi\\); that is true for purely potential flows or (in 2\u2011D) for the special case where the divergence\u2011free part happens to vanish.  In higher dimensions the mismatch is even more common.\n\nSo the statement is proven: a Helmholtz split does **not** imply a geometric\u2011gradient flow, nor\u2014by the same logic\u2014a complex\u2011gradient flow."

              "### Quick answer  \nYes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0if you allow yourself **one notch broader than the usual \u201cpositive\u2011metric scalar\u2011potential\u201d picture** you can cover *every* vector field that admits the Helmholtz split.  Two equivalent ways appear in the literature:\n\n| Label (not mutually exclusive) | Core idea | Covers every Helmholtz field? |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|\n| **Hodge\u2011gradient flow** | Treat the divergence\u2011free part as the (co)differential of a 2\u2011form potential:  \n&nbsp;&nbsp; \\(f^\\flat = d\\Phi + \\delta A\\)  | **Yes** \u2013 this is literally the Hodge decomposition. |\n| **Metriplectic / double\u2011bracket flow** | Keep the symmetric \u201cgradient\u2011descent\u201d part and add an antisymmetric \u201cco\u2011gradient\u201d generated by an independent potential:  \n&nbsp;&nbsp; \\(\\dot x = -\\,M\\nabla\\Phi + L\\nabla\\Psi\\) with \\(M^{\\mathsf T}=M\\!\\ge0\\), \\(L^{\\mathsf T}=-L.\\) | **Yes** \u2013 pick \\(M=I\\), \\(\\Phi\\) from Helmholtz, \\(L\\) any Poisson resolver for the divergence\u2011free part. |\n\nBoth frameworks *mathematically* extend \u201cgradient descent\u201d so that **every Helmholtz\u2011decomposable field fits**. Below is a succinct explanation.\n\n---\n\n## 1\u2003Helmholtz recap  \n\nFor smooth \\(f:\\mathbb R^{n}\\to\\mathbb R^{n}\\) (fast\u2011decay or periodic),\n\n\\[\nf=-\\nabla\\Phi + w,\\qquad \\nabla\\!\\cdot w = 0.\n\\tag{H}\n\\]\n\nThe stumbling block for ordinary gradient flows is the solenoidal term\u00a0\\(w\\).\n\n---\n\n## 2\u2003Hodge\u2011gradient perspective  \n\nThink of \\(f^\\flat\\) as a **1\u2011form**.  The Hodge decomposition says\n\n\\[\nf^\\flat = d\\Phi + \\delta A + h\n\\]\n\nwith \\(h\\) harmonic (often \\(h=0\\) on \\(\\mathbb R^{n}\\)).  \nHere \\(d\\) (exterior derivative) is the usual scalar\u2011gradient; \\(\\delta = (-1)^{n(k+1)+1}\u22c6d\u22c6\\) is its \u201cco\u2011gradient\u2019\u2019 cousin that produces divergence\u2011free fields from a **2\u2011form potential** \\(A\\).  \n\nHence *both* pieces are \u201cgradients\u201d \u2014 just of **different differential\u2011form degrees**.  \nWriting a flow as\n\n\\[\n\\dot x^\\flat = -\\,d\\Phi - \\delta A\n\\]\n\nuses nothing beyond Helmholtz but counts as a \u201cgradient\u2011descent\u201d in the **de\u00a0Rham complex**.  Analysts sometimes call such objects **Hodge gradient flows**.\n\n---\n\n## 3\u2003Metriplectic / double\u2011bracket formulation  \n\nSplit a velocity field into\n\n\\[\n\\dot x = -M\\nabla\\Phi \\;+\\; L\\nabla\\Psi ,\n\\tag{MP}\n\\]\n\nwith  \n\n* \\(M\\)\u00a0\u2013 symmetric positive (dissipative metric),  \n* \\(L\\)\u00a0\u2013 antisymmetric satisfying Jacobi (Poisson),  \n* \\(\\Phi\\)\u00a0\u2013 \u201centropy/Lyapunov\u201d,  \n* \\(\\Psi\\)\u00a0\u2013 \u201cenergy/Hamiltonian.\u201d\n\nGiven Helmholtz (H):\n\n1.  **Choose \\(M=I\\)** (or any positive metric).  \n2.  **Take \\(\\Phi\\)** as the same scalar potential from Helmholtz.  \n3.  **Find \\(L,\\Psi\\) for \\(w\\):**  \n    * In 2\u2011D set \\(L=J\\) and \\(\\Psi\\) the stream\u2011function (always possible).  \n    * In higher \\(n\\), pick any Poisson structure that reproduces \\(w\\) (may need degenerate \\(L\\)).  \n    That\u2019s always feasible because \\(w\\) is divergence free; solving \\(L\\nabla\\Psi = w\\) with degenerate \\(L\\) of rank\u00a02 is enough.\n\nThus every Helmholtz field sits inside (MP).  Equation\u00a0(MP) is often called a **metriplectic** or **GENERIC\u2011lite** system and is a bona\u2011fide \u201cgradient\u2009+\u2009co\u2011gradient\u201d descent.\n\n---\n\n## 4\u2003Relation to *complex* gradient  \n\n* In **2\u00a0D** the antisymmetric operator \\(J\\) *is* multiplication by \\(i\\);  \n  \\(M=I,\\;L=J\\) folds (MP) into one complex equation  \n\n  \\[\n  \\dot z = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{\\!*}}\\;(\\Phi + i\\Psi).\n  \\]\n\n  So \u201ccomplex gradient\u201d is the 2\u2011D facade of the Hodge/metriplectic split.  \n\n* In **\\(n>2\\)** you need several independent \\(J\\)\u2019s (or full Clifford algebra).  That recovers the geometric\u2011algebra generalisation of the complex trick.\n\n---\n\n## 5\u2003What you \u201cpay\u201d to get universality  \n\n* You **double the set of potentials**: one scalar for dissipation, one (or several) for rotation.  \n* The antisymmetric operator \\(L\\) may be **degenerate**; Jacobi can always be met by taking rank\u20112 brackets in coordinate pairs.  \n* The Lyapunov property holds for \\(\\Phi\\) (\\(\\dot\\Phi\\le0\\)); \\(\\Psi\\) is conserved only if \\(L\\) satisfies Jacobi.  That is automatically true in 2\u2011D, needs care in higher \\(n\\).\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \nYes.  By accepting either **Hodge gradient flows** (gradient of different\u2011degree forms) *or* **metriplectic/double\u2011bracket flows** (symmetric\u2009+\u2009antisymmetric operator pair), **every** vector field that enjoys a Helmholtz decomposition can be described as a \u201cgradient\u2011descent\u2011type\u201d evolution.  In 2\u2011D this collapses exactly to the familiar *complex gradient flow*; in higher dimensions it requires the richer language of differential forms or geometric algebra."

To express this as a generalized gradient flow, I want to use the de Rham gradient operator, but \u03c1 is scalar.

              "Let\u2019s strip away the algebra and look at what the algorithm is *doing*.\n\n---\n\n### 1\u202f.  Picture the flow as taffy\n\nImagine the state\u2011space of your dynamical system is a lump of soft taffy.  \nPick a point \\(x(t)\\) on the taffy and draw a tiny sphere of ink dots around it.  \nAs the system evolves, the sphere is dragged along and distorted into a skinny **ellipsoid**.\n\n* The **lengths** of that ellipsoid\u2019s semi\u2011axes tell you *how much* stretching or squashing happened in each direction.\n* The **directions** of the axes tell you *where* the stretching happened.\n\nThose axis lengths grow (or shrink) roughly like \\(e^{\\lambda_i t}\\); the exponents \\(\\lambda_i\\) are the Lyapunov exponents you want.\n\n---\n\n### 2\u202f.  What Gram\u2013Schmidt is actually tracking\n\nIn practice you cannot march forward a whole cloud of dots, so you do the next best thing:\n\n1. Carry along a handful of little arrows (perturbation vectors) that start orthonormal.  \n2. Push them through the linearised dynamics for a small time \\(\\Delta t\\).  \n3. They come out stretched, bent and no longer orthogonal.  \n4. **Re\u2011orthonormalise** them (QR or Gram\u2013Schmidt) and record the individual stretch factors before you rescale.\n\nThat *re\u2011orthonormalised set of arrows* at the end of step\u202f3 is exactly the set the algorithm calls \u201ceigenvectors.\u201d They are:\n\n* the **principal axes of the *current* ellipsoid** built from all stretching that has happened *since the distant past* up to the present moment;\n* or, more formally, the orthonormal eigenvectors of the finite\u2011time **Cauchy\u2013Green tensor**  \n  \\(C(t)=\\Phi(t)^{\\mathsf T}\\Phi(t)\\) (the matrix that turns the starting sphere into the ellipsoid).\n\nBecause you repeat the procedure over and over, those axes settle down to the **time\u2011dependent directions that have been stretched the most on average so far**. These are called the **backward Lyapunov vectors** (they know about past stretching, not future).\n\n---\n\n### 3\u202f.  Why they *aren\u2019t* Jacobian eigenvectors\n\n* The Jacobian \\(J(x)\\) only contains *instantaneous* information, like the local slope of a hill.\n* The ellipsoid axes (the vectors you get) encode the **integrated history of stretching** over a long time window.  \n  They are therefore *not* eigenvectors of \\(J\\); they are eigenvectors of the *integrated* object \\(C(t)\\).\n\n---\n\n### 4\u202f.  Where the exponents come from\n\nDuring each orthonormalisation you also keep the scale factors you had to divide out (the diagonal of the \\(R\\) in QR).  \nAdd their logs, divide by the total time, and you converge to the Lyapunov exponents \\(\\lambda_i\\).\n\n---\n\n#### 15\u2011second takeaway\n\n* **What you keep:** an orthonormal set of arrows that line up with the longest axes of the \u201cstretching ellipsoid\u201d produced by *all* past dynamics.  \n* **What they really are:** eigenvectors of the *finite\u2011time* Cauchy\u2013Green tensor \\(C(t)=\\Phi(t)^{\\mathsf T}\\Phi(t)\\).  \n* **Why they matter:** they reveal\u2014and decouple\u2014the directions associated with each Lyapunov exponent, letting you measure the exponential stretch factors cleanly.\n\nI hope that picture of spheres turning into ellipsoids\u2014and Gram\u2013Schmidt continuously realigning your arrows with their principal axes\u2014gives you a more intuitive grasp of what those \u201ceigenvectors\u201d are."

Instantaneous Jacobian eigenvectors  \n\n*What they are*  \nThe eigenvectors of the Jacobian \\(J(x(t))\\) are directions that would grow or shrink **if the flow froze at this very instant**.\n\n*Why they\u2019re limited*  \nA millisecond later the Jacobian changes, so those directions rarely stay special for long. They capture the *local* tilt of the slope under your feet, not the accumulated ride.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Finite\u2011time (backward) Lyapunov vectors  \n*(the columns of the \\(Q\\) you get after every Gram\u2013Schmidt step)*  \n\n*What they are*  \nTake every arrow you started with, drag it forward for a chunk of time, then do a QR\u2011decomposition.  \nThe orthonormal columns of \\(Q\\) line up with the axes along which the cloud has **already** been stretched the most *since the distant past*.  \nMathematically they diagonalise the \u201chow\u2011much\u2011did\u2011I\u2011stretch\u201d matrix  \n\\(C(t)=\\Phi^{\\mathsf T}\\Phi\\) (the Cauchy\u2013Green tensor), so they are its eigenvectors.\n\n*How they pair with the exponents*  \nFor each column \\(q_i\\) you also get a cumulative factor \\(\\rho_i\\) (the running product of the \\(R_{ii}\\)\u2019s).  \n\\[\n\\lambda_i = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{t}\\log\\rho_i\n\\]\nis the Lyapunov exponent: the long\u2011term average exponential rate of *past* stretching of that direction.\n\n*Interpretation*  \n\u201cPoint an arrow so that, looking *back*, it is the one that got lengthened the most (first exponent), the second most, \u2026\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Forward Lyapunov vectors  \n\nDo the same trick but **run the movie backward in time first**, then forward to \u201cnow\u201d.  \nYou obtain an orthonormal basis that answers the mirror question:  \n\n> \u201cWhich directions will experience the most stretching *from now on* if I look far into the future?\u201d\n\nThese two bases (past\u2011optimised and future\u2011optimised) are generally *different.*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs)  \n\n*What they are*  \nVectors that are winners **both backward and forward**: pick one now, let the flow carry it, and it will always stay in the subspace belonging to the same exponent. They \u201ccovary\u201d with the dynamics.\n\n*Why they matter*  \nCLVs are the genuine tangent directions of the system\u2019s stable/unstable manifolds.  \nIf you perturb the state *exactly* along a CLV whose exponent is \\(+\\lambda\\), the error will grow like \\(e^{\\lambda t}\\) no matter how long you run.  \nThey are usually *not* orthogonal to each other, which is why the one\u2011pass Gram\u2013Schmidt algorithm cannot give them directly; you need an additional backward sweep (Ginelli et\u202fal., 2007).\n\n---\n\n### How to read the exponents once you have a vector basis\n\n| Exponent sign | What the matching vector means | Everyday analogy |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Positive** | Perturbations grow (sensitive direction) | Dough is being pulled in this axis |\n| **Zero** | Neutral direction (often the flow direction itself) | Mark floating on water, carried but not stretched |\n| **Negative** | Errors contract (stable direction) | Axis along which dough is squashed |\n\n*Largest positive \u03bb*  \u2192 butterfly\u2011effect rate.  \n*Sum of positive \u03bb\u2019s* \u2192 Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy (chaos production).\n\n---\n\n### Putting it back into the confetti picture\n\n* **Jacobian eigenvector** \u2013 how the breeze pushes the confetti *this very second*.  \n* **Backward Lyapunov vector** \u2013 the axis along which the cloud **got spread out** the most so far.  \n* **Forward Lyapunov vector** \u2013 the axis along which the cloud **will spread out** the most from now on.  \n* **Covariant Lyapunov vector** \u2013 an arrow you can paint on a confetti piece **now**; whichever way you replay the movie it always stays aligned with the same stretching axis.\n\nAnd every time you see the number \\(e^{\\lambda t}\\) next to one of those arrows, read it as  \n> \u201cIf I make a hair\u2011thin displacement along this arrow, it will be \\(e^{\\lambda t}\\) times larger after time \\(t\\).\u201d"

              "Below is a pragmatic \u201crecipe\u201d for **covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs)**, followed by answers to the common questions that come up once you start coding it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Two\u2013pass algorithm (Ginelli et\u202fal., 2007)\n\n> **Forward pass (store the stretch history)**  \n> 1. Integrate the state \\(x(t)\\) from \\(t_0\\) to \\(t_N\\).  \n> 2. In tangent space carry an \\(m\\times m\\) matrix \\(W(t)\\) whose columns are \\(m\\) linearly\u2011independent perturbations (usually \\(m=d\\), the phase\u2011space dimension).  \n> 3. Every \\(\\Delta t\\) do a QR decomposition  \n>    \\[\n>      W_k = Q_k R_k ,\n>    \\]  \n>    replace \\(W \\leftarrow Q\\), and **store the upper\u2013triangular \\(R_k\\)** (you can keep just its diagonal if you only need the exponents).  \n>    The columns of \\(Q_k\\) are the **backward Lyapunov vectors** at time step \\(k\\).  \n> 4. Accumulate the logs of the \\(R_{k,ii}\\) diagonals to get the Lyapunov exponents.\n\n> **Backward pass (dig the covariant directions out)**  \n> Starting from the last time step \\(N\\) set an identity matrix of expansion coefficients  \n> \\[\n>   C_N = I .\n> \\]  \n> For \\(k=N\\!-\\!1\\) down to \\(0\\):\n> 1. **Propagate the coefficients back** with the inverse\u2011transpose of the stored \\(R\\):\n>    \\[\n>       C_k = R_{k+1}^{-1} C_{k+1} .\n>    \\]\n>    (Because \\(W_{k+1}=Q_{k+1}R_{k+1}\\) \u21d2 \\(R_{k+1}^{\\!-1}=Q_{k+1}^\\mathsf T\\Phi_{k+1}^{-1}Q_k\\), which unwinds the forward Gram\u2013Schmidt.)  \n> 2. **Normalise each column** of \\(C_k\\) (it prevents over/under\u2011flow; the norms factor out into the exponents anyway).  \n> 3. **Build the CLVs** at that time:\n>    \\[\n>       V_k = Q_k C_k .\n>    \\]\n>    The \\(i\\)-th column \\(v_k^{(i)}\\) is the CLV associated with the \\(i\\)-th Lyapunov exponent at step \\(k\\).\n\nMemory tip\u2003You only need to keep the upper\u2011triangular \\(R_k\\) (or its LU factors) plus, optionally, the diagonals of \\(Q_k\\) if you need signs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\n### (a) *Why do \u201cduplicates\u201d appear and how do I avoid them?*\n\n1. **Degenerate exponents**  \n   If \\(\\lambda_i=\\lambda_{i+1}=\\ldots=\\lambda_{i+m-1}\\), the associated Oseledec subspace is *m\u2011dimensional*.  \n   The algorithm will happily give you *any* basis of that subspace\u2014so the CLVs you see can look \u201cduplicated\u201d (strongly aligned) or rotate within that subspace from run to run.  \n   *What to do:*  \n   * group the vectors by identical (to numerical tolerance) exponents instead of treating them one\u2011by\u2011one;  \n   * if you really need a \u201ccanonical\u201d frame, post\u2011process that block with an extra orthogonalisation or apply physical symmetry constraints.\n\n2. **Insufficient integration time**  \n   Convergence of each block is exponential with a gap proportional to \\(|\\lambda_{i}-\\lambda_{i+1}|\\).  \n   With too little time, adjacent vectors may not separate and appear as duplicates.  \n   *Rule of thumb:* integrate until the running exponents\u2019 averages stop drifting (often \\(10\u201320\\) Lyapunov times for chaotic flows).\n\n3. **Round\u2011off error in strongly contracting directions**  \n   When \\(\\lambda\\ll0\\) the corresponding vectors are easily lost in the machine\u2011precision noise.  \n   *Mitigation:* use 64\u2011bit arithmetic (or higher), renormalise every few steps, and discard directions whose cumulative stretch has fallen below a set threshold.\n\n### (b) *Is there a one\u2011to\u2011one mapping between backward LVs / exponents and CLVs?*\n\n* **Exponents \u2194 Oseledec subspaces**\u2003Yes: every distinct Lyapunov exponent labels one invariant subspace; the dimension of that subspace equals the exponent\u2019s multiplicity.  \n* **Backward LVs \u2194 CLVs**\u2003Not one\u2011to\u2011one (except when all exponents are simple).  \n  - Backward LVs form an orthonormal frame that diagonalises the *past* stretch tensor; they are guaranteed orthogonal but **not** covariant.  \n  - CLVs are covariant but, in the degenerate case, *any* linear combination inside the degenerate block of backward LVs can become the CLV block after the second pass.\n\nIn short, you always get *the same* set of subspaces, but the individual vector representatives inside a degenerate block are not unique.\n\n### (c) *What do CLVs typically look like in a chaotic system?*\n\n* **Leading (largest\u2011\u03bb) CLV** \u2013 aligns with the most actively expanding direction of the attractor; within an ergodic region it tends to sit along the local unstable manifold.  \n* **Intermediate CLVs** \u2013 weave through the tangle of stretching and folding sheets; often highly filamentary and non\u2011orthogonal.  \n* **Near\u2011zero CLVs** \u2013 one of them coincides with the flow direction (time translation symmetry). Others indicate marginally stable structures such as shear layers or conservation constraints.  \n* **Strongly negative\u2011\u03bb CLVs** \u2013 fold quickly back into directions normal to the attractor; they can fluctuate wildly in orientation because they feel very little dynamical \u201ctension\u201d once contracted.\n\nVisualising them (plotting a handful along a trajectory) you usually see:\n\n* A **fan\u2011out** of vectors in the unstable manifold, each one shadowing the next stretch scale.  \n* A set of **crumpled, almost tangential** vectors for weak exponents (|\u03bb|\u202f\u2248\u202f0).  \n* A ribbon of **orthogonal\u2011looking but covariant** stable directions that hug the attractor\u2019s local stable manifold.\n\nBecause CLVs are not orthogonal, the angles between consecutive ones can be very small\u2014exactly the feature exploited by algorithms that estimate finite\u2011time Lyapunov dimension via the Kaplan\u2013Yorke conjecture.\n\n---\n\n### Key takeaways\n\n* Run a **QR forward pass**, save the \\(R_k\\); then a **backward sweep** with \\(R_k^{-1}\\) gives you **covariant** directions.  \n* Duplicate\u2011looking vectors signal **degeneracy** or **insufficient convergence**; treat equal\u2011\u03bb blocks as a unit.  \n* Each distinct exponent \u2194 one invariant subspace; within a degenerate block the CLVs are defined only up to any non\u2011singular linear mix.  \n* In chaotic flows you\u2019ll see a structured fan: strongly unstable, weakly unstable, neutral, and strongly stable directions\u2014together forming the skeleton that supports stretching\u2011and\u2011folding chaos.\n\nOnce you have those CLVs you have the \u201cbones\u201d of the dynamics: perturb exactly along them to probe stability, build reduced models, or initialise ensemble forecasts with physically meaningful spread."

              "Short answer: **yes\u2014it\u2019s a clue about what kind of instability dominates your PDE, and it also warns you about a possible symmetry you have (or have accidentally broken).**\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Why a \u2011\u2202/\u2202x shape can pop out as the \u201cbiggest\u201d backward LV  \n\nThink of the field \\(u(x,t)\\).  A tiny rigid shift\n\\[\nu(x,t)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;u(x+\\varepsilon,t)\n          \\;=\\;u(x,t)+\\varepsilon\\,\\partial_x u(x,t)+\\mathcal O(\\varepsilon^2)\n\\]\nis represented in tangent space by the vector **\\(\\partial_x u\\)**.  \nSo whenever the system is (approximately) **translation\u2011invariant in \\(x\\)**, that vector is a natural direction to consider.\n\n* **Exact symmetry** (periodic BCs, homogeneous coefficients)  \n  The shift is a **Goldstone mode**: it costs no \u201cenergy,\u201d so its Lyapunov exponent should be **exactly zero**.  \n  \u2013\u202fIf it shows up with a *small* exponent close to 0, everything is consistent.\n\n* **Broken or weak symmetry** (e.g. non\u2011periodic BCs, spatial inhomogeneity, mean advection)  \n  A mere shift is *not* an exact symmetry any more.  Instead, phase errors can get **amplified or damped**, and \\(\\partial_x u\\) may inherit a **positive exponent**.  \n  \u2013\u202fThat is why it can become the **largest** backward LV.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Practical implications\n\n| Observation | What it tells you | What you might do |\n|-------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **\u03bb\u202f\u2248\u202f0** for that LV | Your numerics respect translation symmetry. | Nothing to fix. But remember this neutral direction can dominate ensemble spread; remove it if you want to study *shape* instabilities only (e.g. transform to a comoving frame). |\n| **\u03bb\u202f>\u202f0** and LV \u2248\u202f\u2202/\u2202x | Largest growth is basically a *phase\u2011shift error* travelling through the domain (convective instability). | \u2022 Re\u2011examine BCs / inhomogeneity.<br>\u2022 If you *intend* physical advection, good\u2014largest LE measures how quickly two solutions desynchronise due to relative drift.<br>\u2022 In data assimilation or control, you must track the phase very accurately; otherwise forecasts blow up fast. |\n| **\u03bb\u202f\u226b\u202f0**  but LV has high\u2011k, noise\u2011like structure as well as \u2202/\u2202x | Likely mixture of translation and genuine internal instability (degenerate exponents). | Integrate longer; block\u2011orthogonalise vectors that share equal \u03bb; use the CLV algorithm to separate \u201cpure shift\u201d from \u201creal chaos.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n### 3.  One\u2013to\u2013one mapping caveat  \n\nThe backward LV you spotted is not automatically the CLV for the same exponent:\n\n* If \\(\\lambda_1\\) is simple and far from \\(\\lambda_2\\), both the first backward LV **and** the first CLV converge to that \u2202/\u2202x\u2011like shape\u2014good.\n* If \\(\\lambda_1\\) is nearly degenerate (e.g. two equal leading exponents because shifts in both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions are almost neutral), the forward/backward routines mix them.  You\u2019ll need the two\u2011pass CLV extraction to resolve each direction cleanly.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  What to check next\n\n1. **Confirm the exponent value**:  \n   *Plot the running average of \\(\\log R_{11}/t\\)*.  If it drifts toward 0, you\u2019re looking at a symmetry mode.\n2. **Visualise the CLVs**:  \n   Run the backward sweep; plot the first few CLVs.  See whether only the first inherits the \u2202/\u2202x pattern or a whole block does.\n3. **Try a comoving frame**:  \n   Define \\(x' = x - c t\\) with \\(c\\) the mean advection speed (estimate by spatial cross\u2011correlation).  Recompute the spectrum\u2014does that large exponent shrink to zero?  If so, you\u2019ve isolated pure advection from intrinsic chaos.\n4. **Boundary\u2011condition experiment**:  \n   Switch to periodic BCs temporarily; if the leading LE drops to \u2248\u202f0 you\u2019ve verified the \u201cbroken symmetry\u201d interpretation.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA leading backward LV that looks like a spatial gradient is **not just a curiosity**\u2014it tells you the system is **most sensitive to small phase shifts along \\(x\\)**.  \nWhether that sensitivity is **neutral** (symmetry) or **destabilising** (convective growth) depends on how faithfully your model and numerics preserve translation invariance.  Understanding this helps:\n\n* interpret the Lyapunov spectrum correctly,\n* design better perturbations for forecasting or control,\n* and separate genuine \u201cshape chaos\u201d from mere drifting of patterns."

              "Below is a \u201cfield guide\u201d to what a spectrum that looks like  \n\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 \\;\\approx\\; +0.005 \\quad\\gg\\quad\n\\lambda_2 \\;\\approx\\; +1\\times10^{-5} \\;\\;(\\text{or }0)\n\\quad>\\quad\n\\lambda_3,\\,\\lambda_4,\\dots<0\n\\]\n\nusually means in practice for a spatially extended system (PDE).\n\n---\n\n## 1.  What the numbers say in plain language  \n\n| Quantity | Value | Physical reading (using your code\u2019s time\u2011unit **t**) |\n|----------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **e\u2011folding time** \\(T_e = 1/\\lambda_1\\) | \\(\\;\\approx 200\\;t\\) | A displacement grows by a factor *e* in \u2248\u202f200 time units. |\n| **Doubling time** \\(T_{2} = \\ln 2/\\lambda_1\\) | \u2248\u202f140\u202ft | Errors double in amplitude every 140 time units. |\n| **Predictability horizon** (10\u2011million\u2011fold blow\u2011up from round\u2011off \\(10^{-6}\\)) | \\(t_p = |\\ln(10^{-6})|/\\lambda_1 \\approx 2.8\\times10^{3}\\,t\\) | Past ~2\u202f800\u202ft your numerical trajectory cannot track a real one. |\n\nSo the system **is chaotic (\u03bb\u2081>0)**, but only *weakly* so: divergence is 2\u20133 orders of magnitude slower than in \u201chard\u2011chaos\u201d flows such as Lorenz\u201163 (\u03bb\u2081\u22481).\n\n---\n\n## 2.  A **large spectral gap** (\u03bb\u2081 \u226b \u03bb\u2082)\n\n### 2.1 Dynamical meaning  \n* The tangent space has **one strongly unstable dimension**; all other perturbations either decay or grow so slowly that they behave as *neutral* on practical time scales.  \n  *Visually*: the attractor looks like a thin ribbon being pulled apart mainly along one axis, then folded and damped in every other direction.\n\n### 2.2 Reduced\u2011order modelling payoff  \n* **One\u2011direction chaos** \u21d2 you can often capture the long\u2011term statistics with a *single* phase\u2011like degree of freedom modulating a quasi\u2011periodic backbone.  \n* Proper orthogonal decomposition or dynamic\u2011mode reduction will show one energetic mode dominating the positive\u2011LE subspace.\n\n### 2.3 Ensemble / data\u2011assimilation hint  \n* Spread your ensemble **primarily along CLV\u202f#1**; extra random noise in the other directions wastes resolution\u2014those components neither grow nor affect forecast error on the time window of interest.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  What might generate that spectrum in a PDE\n\n1. **Slow convective or phase instability**  \n   *If* your leading CLV resembles \\(+\\partial_x u\\) (as you observed earlier), \u03bb\u2081 reflects the rate at which two patterns drift apart because of slightly different advection speeds.\n\n2. **Near\u2011critical bifurcation**  \n   The system may sit just past a Hopf or Turing threshold; only one mode has crossed into positive growth.  Every other Fourier mode is still damped, hence \u03bb\u2082\u2026 are \u2248\u202f0 or negative.\n\n3. **Undersampling / finite\u2011time artefact**  \n   A true second positive exponent could be hiding below your detection limit.  Double\u2011check by:\n   * running 5\u201310 times longer,\n   * testing various Gram\u2011Schmidt intervals,\n   * tightening the tolerance that decides \u201czero.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Consequences for diagnostics you might compute\n\n| Quantity | Formula (one positive exponent) |  Your numbers |\n|----------|---------------------------------|---------------|\n| **Kaplan\u2013Yorke (Lyapunov) dimension** \\(D_{KY}=1+\\dfrac{\\lambda_1}{|\\lambda_2|}\\)  | If \\(\\lambda_2<0\\) and e.g. \\(\\lambda_2=-0.1\\) \u21d2 \\(D_{KY}\\approx1+0.005/0.1=1.05\\) | System behaves almost 1\u2011D (a slightly fuzzy limit cycle). |\n| **Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy** \\(h_{KS}=\\sum_{\\lambda_i>0}\\lambda_i\\) | \u2248\u202f0.005 | Very low information\u2011production rate; long\u2011term statistics converge quickly. |\n| **Fractal correlation dimension** \\(D_2\\) | Nearly 1 | Confirm with Grassberger\u2013Procaccia if desired. |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Practical steps / checks\n\n1. **Run a CLV calculation.**  \n   You should find **exactly one CLV with a distinctly positive finite\u2011time growth**; the rest hover near 0 or decay.\n\n2. **Test symmetry removal.**  \n   Work in a comoving frame (subtract mean advection velocity).  If \u03bb\u2081 drops to \u2248\u202f0, you know the \u201cchaos\u201d was just a wandering phase\u2014good for understanding, crucial for control.\n\n3. **Stability margin experiment.**  \n   Slowly vary the parameter you suspect controls the instability.  Plot \u03bb\u2081(\u03bc).  A linear rise through zero confirms a supercritical bifurcation picture.\n\n4. **Error\u2011growth forecast.**  \n   For operational predictions, pick an initial uncertainty \u03b5\u2080.  Your safe lead time \\(T^* \\approx \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1}\\ln\\frac{\\text{acceptable error}}{\\varepsilon_0}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n*Your system is just barely chaotic*: trajectories diverge, but only on a time scale two orders of magnitude longer than the intrinsic oscillation period.  \nBecause \u03bb\u2081 stands far above the rest, **one direction of phase\u2011like error\u2014probably the \u2202/\u2202x shift\u2014dominates predictability, data\u2011assimilation spread, and reduced\u2011order modelling effort.**"

              "Here are several ways you can get a batched JVP without ever forming the full Jacobian or relying on `vmap`\u202f+\u202f`torch.autograd.functional.*`:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Just loop over your tangent vectors\n\nIf `V` has shape `(N, k)`, you can simply do a Python loop over the `k` columns:\n\n```python\ndef batched_jvp_loop(f, x, V, dt):\n    # V: (dim, k)\n    outs = []\n    for i in range(V.shape[-1]):\n        _, jvp_i = jvp(f, x, V[:, i], create_graph=False)\n        outs.append(V[:, i] + dt * jvp_i)\n    return torch.stack(outs, dim=1)\n```\n\n**Pros:**  \n- Straightforward  \n- Only needs standard `jvp`\n\n**Cons:**  \n- Python\u2010level loop, so can be slow if `k` is large.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Use\u202ffunctorch\u2019s\u202fforward\u2010mode transforms\n\nPyTorch\u2019s [`functorch`](https://pytorch.org/functorch/stable/) gives you explicit `jvp` and `vmap` that *do* play nicely together. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom functorch import jvp as f_jvp, vmap\n\n# first wrap f to return just the JVP\ndef jvp_single(x, v):\n    _, j = f_jvp(f, (x, ), (v, ))\n    return j\n\n# then vmap over the second axis of V\nbatched_jvp = vmap(jvp_single, in_dims=(None, 1), out_dims=1)\n\n# now\nY = V + dt * batched_jvp(x, V)\n```\n\nHere we:\n\n1.   Use `functorch.jvp` to get a *single* tangent output.  \n2.   `vmap` over your batch\u2011of\u2011tangent dimension.  \n\n**Pros:**  \n- Fully batched on the GPU  \n- No Python loop  \n\n**Cons:**  \n- Requires installing/using\u202f`functorch`  \n- You have to split out the JVP functor\n\n---\n\n### 3. Finite\u2010difference directional derivative\n\nIf you can tolerate a small approximation error you can approximate\n\\[\n\\mathrm{JVP}(f,x;v)=\\frac{d}{d\\epsilon}f(x+\\epsilon v)\\big\\vert_{\\epsilon=0}\n\\]\nvia central differences:\n\n```python\ndef approx_jvp_fd(f, x, v, eps=1e-3):\n    f_plus  = f(x + eps*v)\n    f_minus = f(x - eps*v)\n    return (f_plus - f_minus) / (2*eps)\n\ndef batched_jvp_fd(f, x, V, dt, eps=1e-3):\n    # V: (dim, k)\n    # approximate each column\n    JVs = [(approx_jvp_fd(f, x, V[:, i], eps)) for i in range(V.shape[-1])]\n    J = torch.stack(JVs, dim=1)\n    return V + dt * J\n```\n\n**Pros:**  \n- No autograd hacks at all  \n- Trivially batchable (you can replace the list\u2010comp by a single `vmap`)\n\n**Cons:**  \n- Only approximate (error \u223cO(\u03b5\u00b2))  \n- Requires 2\u00d7 the forward passes per tangent vector\n\n---\n\n### 4. Custom `torch.autograd.Function` (forward\u2010mode via reverse comb)\n\nYou can write your own `Function` that in its forward pass uses *reverse\u2010mode* (`torch.autograd.grad`) to compute the directional derivative, then packages that up as the \u201cforward\u201d output. Sketch:\n\n```python\nclass JVP(Function):\n    @staticmethod\n    def forward(ctx, x, v):\n        ctx.save_for_backward(x, v)\n        x = x.detach().requires_grad_(True)\n        f_x = f(x)\n        # compute directional derivative via v^T Jacobian = grad(f_x\u00b71, x) but for each output...\n        # so you\u2019d actually need to loop over output dims unless you can do a clever aggregate...\n        # this is a bit involved, so I\u2019ll just point you here as a pattern.\n        Jv = directional_via_grad(f, x, v)\n        return f_x, Jv\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def backward(ctx, grad_f, grad_jv):\n        # define your own backward if needed; often you can ignore backward-of-the-JVP\n        return None, None  # or real grads if you need them\n\n# use it as\nf_x, Jv = JVP.apply(x, v)\n```\n\n**Pros:**  \n- All in\u2010PyTorch; once written, you can batch however you like  \n- Exact (up to floating\u2010point)\n\n**Cons:**  \n- You have to hand\u2010roll the reverse\u2010mode trick to compute a *directional* derivative  \n- A bit of boilerplate\n\n---\n\n### 5. If your `f` is a small composition, push the batch through manually\n\nIf `f = f\u2082\u2218f\u2081`, you can propagate your batch of tangent vectors through each primitive:\n\n```python\n# suppose f1: R^n\u2192R^m, then f2: R^m\u2192R^p\n# you already have x and a batch V of size (n, k)\n\n# 1) primal\nx1 = f1(x)                     # \u2192 (m,)\n# push the k tangents through f1\u2019s linearization:\n_, J1 = jvp(f1, x, V, create_graph=False)  # J1: (m, k)\n\n# 2) now treat each J1-column as input tangents to f2\n_, J2 = jvp(f2, x1, J1, create_graph=False)  # J2: (p, k)\n\n# final push-forward:\nY = V + dt * J2  # if you still want to start from the original V\n```\n\nIf `f` is built from small building\u2010blocks you know how to JVP individually, you can avoid ever touching the full Jacobian.\n\n---\n\n### Which one to pick?\n\n- **Small\u202fk (<50)** & you don\u2019t mind a Python loop \u2192 **Option\u202f1**  \n- **Large\u202fk**, GPU batch important \u2192 **Option\u202f2 (functorch)**  \n- You only need an approximation \u2192 **Option\u202f3**  \n- You want 100% exact, pure\u2010PyTorch, and are happy with a bit of boilerplate \u2192 **Option\u202f4**  \n- `f` is hand\u2010coded from primitives you control \u2192 **Option\u202f5**\n\nFeel free to ask for more detail on any of these!"

              "Here are the most common causes of \u201cunresolved import\u201d and wonky highlighting in VS\u202fCode\u2019s Python support\u2014and how to fix them:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Make sure VS\u202fCode is using the right Python interpreter  \n1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `\u21e7\u2318P`) and run **Python: Select Interpreter**.  \n2. Pick the interpreter (system, Conda, venv, etc.) where your packages actually live.  \n3. If you\u2019re in a virtual\u2011env folder and don\u2019t see it listed, you can point VS\u202fCode at it explicitly by choosing **Enter interpreter path\u2026** and navigating to its `python`/`python.exe`.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 If you switch environments, you\u2019ll usually need to restart the Pylance language server: open the Command Palette and choose **Python: Restart Language Server** (or just reload the window).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tell Pylance/Pyright where your code lives  \nIf you\u2019ve got a custom project layout (e.g. code under `src/`, or you\u2019re doing imports from a sibling folder), VS\u202fCode sometimes can\u2019t infer your project\u2019s root.\n\nIn your workspace (or user) `settings.json` add:  \n```jsonc\n{\n  // \u2026other settings\u2026\n  \"python.analysis.extraPaths\": [\n    \"./src\",        // adjust this to wherever your code/packages live\n    \"./lib\",        // add as many as you need\n  ],\n  \"python.analysis.useImportHeuristic\": true\n}\n```\n- **extraPaths** tells the analyzer to look there for modules.  \n- **useImportHeuristic** can help Pylance guess imports when you\u2019re doing relative or namespace\u2011style layouts.\n\nAfter saving, reload the window (Command Palette \u2192 **Developer: Reload Window**).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Clean out stale caches  \nSometimes VS\u202fCode or Pylance picks up old bytecode or cache entries:  \n1. Close VS\u202fCode.  \n2. In your project folder, delete any `__pycache__` directories.  \n3. Delete (or rename) `.vscode/` so you get a fresh set of settings.  \n4. Re-open VS\u202fCode and re-select your interpreter.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Verify your dependencies are installed  \nIf you\u2019re seeing unresolved imports for third\u2011party libraries (e.g. `requests`, `pandas`), double\u2011check:\n\n```bash\n# in the same interpreter you selected in VS\u202fCode:\npip show requests\n```\nIf it\u2019s not installed, do:\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\nThen restart the language server.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Check for conflicting extensions  \n- **Disable** any Python\u2011related extensions beyond the official [Microsoft Python extension + Pylance]\u2014ex: \u201cMagicPython\u201d, old Pyright and Jedi extensions, etc.  \n- Having two analyzers fighting can produce weird results.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Update VS\u202fCode & the Python extension  \nBugs get fixed all the time.  \n- **VS\u202fCode** \u2192 Help \u2192 Check for Updates  \n- In the Extensions pane, find **Python** and **Pylance** and click **Update** if available.\n\n---\n\n## 7. As a last resort: switch the language server  \nIf you suspect a Pylance bug, you can try the built\u2011in Jedi:  \n```jsonc\n{\n  \"python.languageServer\": \"Jedi\"\n}\n```\nSave, reload window. Jedi is a bit slower but can unstick you while you wait for a Pylance patch.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist  \n1. [ ] Interpreter selected (and matches your `pip`/`conda`)  \n2. [ ] `python.analysis.extraPaths` covers your custom code folders  \n3. [ ] Caches (`__pycache__`, `.vscode/`) cleared  \n4. [ ] Dependencies installed in that environment  \n5. [ ] Only Microsoft\u2019s Python + Pylance active  \n6. [ ] Everything up to date  \n\nIf you\u2019ve walked through all of those and you\u2019re still stuck, let me know:  \n- Which import is flagged as unresolved?  \n- Are those modules local files, or packages you\u2019ve installed?  \n- What\u2019s your folder layout (a quick tree dump)?  \n\nWith that I can give you a more pinpointed fix."
