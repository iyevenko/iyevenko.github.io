              "Below is a reasonably self\u2010contained way to see why, in the steady state, one can get a simple closed\u2010form \u201cdistribution of \\(\\rho\\)-values\u201d from the PDE\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t \\rho(x,t) \\;=\\; -\\,v(x)\\,\\cdot\\nabla \\rho(x,t)\\;+\\;D(x),\n\\]\n\nand how the well\u2010known special cases \\(D=0\\) and \\(D=\\text{const}<0\\) give particularly simple answers.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Clarifying the Question: \u201cDistribution of \\(\\rho\\)-values\u201d\n\nOften, one first thinks of \\(\\rho(x)\\) as a \u201cdensity in space.\u201d  Here, however, you are asking for *the PDF of the values that \\(\\rho\\) takes*\u2014i.e., we treat \\(\\rho(x)\\) itself as a random variable whose \u201csample space\u201d is the spatial domain \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\).  In symbols:\n\n- Let \\(\\rho:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be the steady\u2010state solution of the PDE.  \n- We then regard the random variable \\(\\rho\\bigl(x\\bigr)\\) by imagining that \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d is drawn according to *some measure* over the domain.  \n\nA common choice (and one that matches many \u201cadvection\u2013reaction\u201d style arguments) is to weight points by the *amount of time* a characteristic (or flow line) spends there under the velocity \\(v\\).  In 1D, one often phrases this as: \u201cIf a particle moves deterministically \\(\\dot x=v(x)\\), the fraction of (long) time it spends near position \\(x\\) is proportional to \\(\\frac{1}{|v(x)|}\\).\u201d  In higher dimensions, an analogous statement holds if we follow trajectories of \\(\\dot{x}=v(x)\\) and ask, on average, how much time is spent in regions of space where \\(\\|v(x)\\|\\) may be large or small.\n\nHence, *the PDF of the random variable* \\(\\rho(x)\\) (where \\(x\\) is \u2018time\u2010in\u2010trajectory weighted\u2019) often emerges as:\n\n\\[\np\\bigl[\\rho(x)\\bigr]\n\\;\\;\\propto\\;\\;\n\\frac{1}{\\bigl\\|v(x)\\bigr\\|},\n\\]\n\nwith an overall normalization to make it integrate to 1 over the range of \\(\\rho\\).  \n\nBelow, we walk through how this arises and how it is modified when \\(D(x)\\neq 0\\).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Steady\u2010State Equation\n\nIn steady\u2010state (\\(\\partial_t\\rho=0\\)), your PDE becomes\n\n\\[\n0 \\;=\\; -\\,v(x)\\cdot\\nabla\\rho(x)\\;+\\;D(x)\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\nv(x)\\cdot\\nabla\\rho(x)\\;=\\;D(x).\n\\]\n\nThis says that \\(\\rho\\) changes along flow lines (characteristics) at a rate determined by \\(D(x)\\).  \n\nA common way to solve or interpret this is:\n\n1.  **Parametrize flow lines** of \\(\\dot{x}=v(x)\\).  Along such a trajectory \\(x(s)\\), we have  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\rho}{ds} \\;=\\; \\nabla\\rho\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\\;\\cdot\\;\\frac{dx}{ds}\n   \\;=\\;\\nabla\\rho\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\\;\\cdot\\;v\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\n   \\;=\\;D\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr).\n   \\]\n2.  Hence, along a characteristic,  \n   \\[\n   \\rho\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\n   \\;=\\;\\int D\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\\,ds \\;+\\;\\text{constant}.\n   \\]\n\nThat \u201cconstant\u201d can be set by boundary or matching conditions (if any), or simply recognized as \u201cthe initial condition along that characteristic.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Case 1: \\(D(x)=0\\)\n\nWhen \\(D(x)\\equiv 0\\), the steady\u2010state condition is\n\n\\[\nv(x)\\,\\cdot\\,\\nabla\\rho(x)\\;=\\;0.\n\\]\n\nEquivalently, \\(\\rho\\) must be constant along every flow line of \\(\\dot{x}=v(x)\\).  Two well\u2010known scenarios can happen:\n\n- **Trivial scenario** (connected domain, nonzero \\(v\\)): Often in a single connected region (with no other constraints), the only solution is that \\(\\rho\\) is a global constant, so the distribution of its values is a delta function.  \n- **Nontrivial scenario** (multiple flow \u201cregions\u201d or boundaries forcing different values): \\(\\rho\\) can be piecewise constant on distinct orbits of \\(v\\).  \n\n### 3.1 Why One Often Sees \\(p(\\rho)=\\|v\\|^{-1}\\)\n\nDespite the above trivial/piecewise\u2010constant comments, there is a *well\u2010known 1D argument* that goes like this:\n\n> If a *particle* moves in 1D via \\(\\dot{x}=v(x)\\) and we sample its position \\(x\\) uniformly in *time*, then the PDF of \\(x\\) is  \n\\[\np_x(x)\\;\\propto\\;\\frac{1}{|v(x)|}.\n\\]\n> This is because to traverse an interval \\(dx\\) near \\(x\\), the particle takes time \\(dt=dx/v(x)\\).  So it \u201clingers\u201d longer where \\(\\lvert v(x)\\rvert\\) is smaller.\n\nNow, if \\(\\rho\\) is (somehow) a monotonic function of \\(x\\) (or piecewise monotonic), one can push this distribution *through* \\(\\rho=f(x)\\) to get a distribution of \\(\\rho\\)-values:\n\n\\[\np_\\rho(\\rho)\\;=\\;p_x\\bigl(x(\\rho)\\bigr)\\;\\biggl|\\frac{dx}{d\\rho}\\biggr|.\n\\]\n\nIn the very special situation where\n1. \\(\\rho\\) *is constant along flow lines*, and  \n2. \\(\\rho\\) *also* is used as a coordinate along which \\(v\\) does not vanish,  \n\nit can reduce nicely to something like\n\n\\[\np_\\rho(\\rho)\\;\\propto\\;\\frac{1}{\\|v\\|}.\n\\]\n\nIn higher dimensions, an analogous \u201ctime\u2010spent\u201d or \u201ctrajectory measure\u201d argument can yield that the fraction of time spent in a volume element \\(d^n x\\) is again weighted by \\(\\|v(x)\\|^{-1}\\).  Then if \\(\\rho\\) happens to be constant on orbits (so effectively \\(\\rho\\) is a single\u2010valued function across that domain), the induced PDF of \\(\\rho\\) is found by the usual Jacobian formula.  \n\nIn short: **yes**, for \\(D=0\\) and a suitable setup (nonzero \\(v\\), possibly 1D, or a geometry where \\(\\rho\\) is \u201cnice\u201d), one finds\n\n\\[\np\\bigl[\\rho(x)\\bigr]\\;\\sim\\;\\frac{1}{\\|v(x)\\|}.\n\\]\n\nThat is the \u201cmeta\u2010distribution\u201d over values of \\(\\rho\\).  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Case 2: \\(D(x)=D\\equiv\\text{const}<0\\)\n\nNow the steady\u2010state equation is\n\n\\[\nv(x)\\,\\cdot\\,\\nabla\\rho(x) \\;=\\; D\n\\quad(\\text{where }D<0).\n\\]\n\n### 4.1  One Dimension (for Concreteness)\n\nLet\u2019s do 1D to see the cleanest derivation.  Then the PDE condition simplifies to\n\n\\[\nv(x)\\,\\frac{d\\rho}{dx}\\;=\\;D\n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dx}\\;=\\;\\frac{D}{v(x)},\n\\]\n\nso\n\n\\[\n\\rho(x)\\;=\\;\\int^x \\!\\frac{D}{v(s)}\\,ds \\;+\\;\\rho_0,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho_0\\) is a constant of integration.  If \\(v(x)\\) is nowhere zero on your domain, \\(\\rho(x)\\) is monotonic in \\(x\\).  \n\nNext, to find the *distribution* of \\(\\rho\\)-values under \u201ctime sampling,\u201d recall the PDF of \\(x\\) is \\(p_x(x)\\propto 1/\\lvert v(x)\\rvert\\).  Then under the monotonic map \\(\\rho=f(x)\\),\n\n\\[\np_\\rho(\\rho) \n\\;=\\;\np_x\\bigl(x(\\rho)\\bigr)\\;\\bigl|\\tfrac{d x}{d\\rho}\\bigr|\n\\;=\\;\n\\Bigl(\\text{const}\\times\\tfrac{1}{\\bigl|v\\bigl(x(\\rho)\\bigr)\\bigr|}\\Bigr)\n\\;\\times\\;\n\\Bigl|\\tfrac{v\\bigl(x(\\rho)\\bigr)}{D}\\Bigr|\n\\;=\\;\n\\text{const}\\times \\frac{1}{|D|}.\n\\]\n\n**Notice: all dependence on \\(x\\) or \\(v(x)\\) drops out**, and we get that \\(p_\\rho(\\rho)\\) is a *constant* (over the range of \\(\\rho\\) that is realized in the domain).  After proper normalization, that means:\n\n> **\\(\\rho\\) is *uniformly* distributed** on its attainable interval, when \\(D<0\\) is constant.\n\n(In words: The PDE *forces* \\(\\rho\\) to vary linearly along the characteristic\u2014while *time\u2010sampling* in space imposes a \\(1/|v|\\) weighting.  Those two \u201ccancel\u201d to give a flat distribution in \\(\\rho\\).)\n\n### 4.2  Higher Dimensions\n\nIn higher\u2010\\(n\\) dimensions, along a flow line (parametrized by arc length \\(s\\) or a suitable parameter), one still has\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\rho}{ds} \\;=\\; D\\quad\\text{(constant)},\n\\]\n\nso \\(\\rho(s)= D\\,s + \\text{const.}\\).  Meanwhile, \u201ctime spent\u201d near \\(x\\) along the trajectory is \\(dt = ds / \\|v(x)\\|\\).  Combine \\(d\\rho = D\\,ds\\) with \\(dt = ds / \\|v\\|\\) to get\n\n\\[\ndt\\;=\\;\\frac{1}{\\|v\\|}\\,\\frac{d\\rho}{D}\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\text{(time in }d\\rho)\\;\\propto\\;\\frac{1}{|D|}.\n\\]\n\nHence once again, the distribution of \\(\\rho\\) along that trajectory is uniform in \\(\\rho\\).  If the flow unites the domain into a single orbit (or one lumps over many orbits in a piecewise way), you still end with \u201c\\(\\rho\\) is (piecewise) uniformly distributed over its range.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Case 3: General \\(D(x)\\) (with Negative Average)\n\nWhen \\(D(x)\\) is neither zero nor a constant, the steady\u2010state condition is still\n\n\\[\nv(x)\\,\\cdot\\,\\nabla\\rho(x)\\;=\\;D(x).\n\\]\n\nAlong a characteristic \\(x(s)\\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\rho}{ds} \\;=\\; D\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201ctime in a small arc length\u201d is \\(dt = ds/\\|v\\|.\\)  Then the time spent in the interval \\(\\rho\\in[\\rho,\\rho+d\\rho]\\) (moving along that flow line) is\n\n\\[\ndt\n\\;=\\;\n\\frac{ds}{\\|v\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\\|}\n\\;=\\;\n\\frac{d\\rho}{D\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\\,\\|v\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\\|}\n\\;\\;(\\text{assuming }D(x(s))\\neq 0).\n\\]\n\nHence, if we look at the induced PDF for \\(\\rho\\) values along that characteristic,\n\n\\[\np_\\rho(\\rho)\n\\;\\propto\\;\n\\frac{1}{\\bigl|\\,D\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\\,\\|v\\bigl(x(s)\\bigr)\\|\\,\\bigr|}.\n\\]\n\nOf course, in multiple dimensions or with complicated domains, \\(\\rho\\) might not be a single\u2010valued function of position, or we might have multiple disconnected sets of characteristics, etc.  In practice, one pieces all such branches together.  The final \u201cglobal\u201d distribution of \\(\\rho\\) is determined by the measure of all \\(x\\)-points that yield the same \\(\\rho\\) (weighted by \\(1/\\|v(x)\\|\\)) and factoring in \\(1/D(x)\\).  \n\n- If \\(\\langle D(x)\\rangle\\) is negative \u201con average,\u201d that typically means \\(\\rho\\) has a net sink term.  But to find the *exact* shape of \\(p(\\rho)\\) for a general \\(D(x)\\) requires doing the integral or the characteristic geometry in detail.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary of the Three Main Cases\n\n1. **\\(D(x)=0\\):**  \n   - Steady state requires \\(v\\cdot\\nabla\\rho=0\\).  \n   - \\(\\rho\\) is constant along orbits.  In the simplest connected domain with no boundary, that often forces \\(\\rho\\equiv \\text{const}\\).  \n   - In a (1D) time\u2010sampling interpretation, if \\(\\rho\\) *were* a monotonic coordinate in the domain, one gets \\(p(\\rho)\\propto 1/\\|v(x)\\|\\).  That is the statement you mentioned, often seen in texts discussing \u201cthe PDF induced by a deterministic flow.\u201d\n\n2. **\\(D(x)=D<0\\) (constant negative):**  \n   - Steady state requires \\(v\\cdot\\nabla\\rho=D\\).  \n   - In 1D, \\(\\rho(x)=\\int (D/v(x))\\,dx\\).  In all dimensions, \\(\\rho\\) changes linearly along flow lines: \\(d\\rho/ds=D\\).  \n   - The weighting by \\(1/\\|v(x)\\|\\) (from time spent) *cancels* the linear change in \\(\\rho\\).  **Conclusion**: \\(\\rho\\) is *uniformly distributed* (over the interval or range it attains).  \n\n3. **\\(D(x)\\) general (negative on average):**  \n   - Still \\(v\\cdot\\nabla\\rho = D(x)\\).  \n   - Along each flow line, \\(\\rho\\) changes with rate \\(D(x(s))\\).  \n   - The fraction of time spent near a given \\(\\rho\\)-value is inversely proportional to \\(\\|v\\|\\cdot D(x)\\).  This typically yields some non\u2010trivial \\(p(\\rho)\\).  \n   - One must do a line integral (or surface integral in higher \\(n\\)) to find the explicit formula, but the principle is the same: *the PDE imposes how \\(\\rho\\) varies along characteristics,* and *the measure \u201ctime in space\u201d imposes a factor \\(1/\\|v\\|\\).*  \n\nThat is the sense in which your statement\n\n\\[\np\\bigl[\\rho(x)\\bigr]\\;=\\;\\frac{1}{\\|v(x)\\|}\n\\quad(\\text{when }D=0)\n\\]\n\ncan be \u201cverified,\u201d and how it generalizes or is modified in the other cases, particularly giving a *constant* PDF in \\(\\rho\\) when \\(D<0\\) is constant."

Thus, the probability density for being at \\(x\\) is\n   \\[\n   p(x) \\propto \\frac{1}{|v(x)|}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Change of Variables:**  \n   When converting from the variable \\(x\\) to \\(\\rho\\) using\n   \\[\n   \\rho(x) = \\rho_0 + \\int^x \\frac{D}{v(s)}\\,ds,\n   \\]\n   the Jacobian of the transformation is\n   \\[\n   \\left|\\frac{d\\rho}{dx}\\right| = \\frac{|D|}{|v(x)|}.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the PDF for \\(\\rho\\) becomes\n   \\[\n   p(\\rho) = p(x)\\left|\\frac{dx}{d\\rho}\\right| \\propto \\frac{1}{|v(x)|} \\cdot \\frac{|v(x)|}{|D|} = \\frac{1}{|D|}.\n   \\]\n\nAfter normalization, you simply get a constant PDF over the range of \\(\\rho\\), meaning that every value of \\(\\rho\\) within that range is equally likely.\n\nFor other cases:\n- When \\(D = 0\\), \\(\\rho\\) remains constant along each trajectory (or piecewise constant), so the notion of a \u201cspread\u201d in \\(\\rho\\)-values becomes degenerate unless there are multiple disconnected regions.\n- For a general \\(D(x)\\), the PDF will be non-uniform and depend on both \\(v(x)\\) and \\(D(x)\\) via the relation\n  \\[\n  p(\\rho) \\propto \\frac{1}{|D(x)|\\,\\|v(x)\\|},\n  \\]\n  evaluated along the characteristic corresponding to \\(\\rho\\).\n\nSo, to answer your question succinctly: **Yes, when \\(D\\) is a nonzero constant (specifically \\(D<0\\)), the meta PDF of \\(\\rho\\) is indeed uniform, i.e. \\(p(\\rho)=\\frac{1}{Z}\\) with \\(Z\\) being the appropriate normalization constant.**"

              "First, let me restate the essence of the question in my own words to make sure it\u2019s clear what we are checking:\n\n1. **We have the Lorenz system** (or indeed any ODE system) \\(\\dot{x} = v(x)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  \n2. Its divergence \\(\\nabla \\cdot v(x)\\) happens to be a constant \\(D = -(\\sigma + 1 + \\beta)\\), i.e.\\ a negative constant.  \n3. We define \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) to satisfy Liouville\u2019s equation  \n   \\[\n   \\partial_t \\rho(x,t)\\;=\\;-\\nabla\\cdot[\\rho(x,t)\\,v(x)],\n   \\]  \n   and then define \\(\\mathcal{I}(x,t)\\equiv -\\log\\rho(x,t)\\).  \n4. By a manipulation, we see that \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) obeys  \n   \\[\n   \\partial_t \\mathcal{I}(x,t) \n   \\;=\\; -\\,v(x)\\cdot\\nabla \\mathcal{I}(x,t) \\;+\\; \\nabla\\cdot v(x),\n   \\]  \n   so it is a linear advection equation with a *constant source term* \\(\\nabla\\cdot v(x)=D<0\\).\n\nBased on the simpler PDE arguments from before, one might guess:\n\n> \u201cIf \\(D<0\\) is constant, then in a steady state, \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) might be \u2018uniformly distributed\u2019 in some sense\u2014and thus  \n\\[\np\\bigl[\\mathcal{I}(x)\\bigr] \n\\;\\stackrel{?}{\\propto}\\; \n\\frac{1}{\\|v(x)\\|\\;\\cdot\\;|D|}\n\\;\\;=\\;\n\\frac{1}{\\|v(x)\\|\\;(\\sigma + 1 + \\beta)},\n\\]\nor perhaps even just uniform in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)-space.\u201d\n\n**Is that conclusion correct or not** for the Lorenz system?\n\nBelow is the short answer and then a longer explanation.\n\n---\n\n## Short Answer\n\n- **It is \\emph{not} correct** to conclude that\n  \\[\n  p(\\mathcal{I}) \\;\\propto\\; \\frac{1}{(\\sigma +1 + \\beta)\\,\\|v(x)\\|}\n  \\quad\\text{(in the Lorenz system).}\n  \\]\n- The \u201cconstant \\(D<0\\)\u201d argument \\emph{would} give a uniform distribution in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) \\emph{if} (and only if) you could sample \\(x\\) in a \u2018time\u2010in\u2010space\u2019 manner \\emph{through the entire phase space} the way we did in simpler PDE examples with well-defined boundary conditions and no long-term collapse to a lower-dimensional attractor.\n- In the actual Lorenz system (and any other flow with negative divergence), phase volume shrinks exponentially, and typical long-time dynamics collapse onto a (possibly fractal) attractor where standard Lebesgue volume in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) is zero.  So the \u201csteady state distribution\u201d (if it exists) is typically a \\emph{singular} invariant measure (an SRB measure) supported on that attractor, not a smooth density over \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). \n- Consequently, the naive PDE-based \u201cuniform distribution\u201d argument breaks down.  The measure is not uniform in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\), nor does it obey the simple formula \\(1/[|D|\\,\\|v(x)\\|]\\).  \n- In fact, for a dissipative system (negative divergence), Liouville\u2019s equation does not \\emph{admit} a globally smooth steady-state density \\(\\rho(x)\\) on all of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  One instead gets a measure that is concentrated on a lower-dimensional attractor.\n\nHence the statement\n\\[\np(\\mathcal{I}(x))\\;\\stackrel{?}{=}\\;\\frac{1}{(\\sigma+1+\\beta)\\,\\|v(x)\\|}\\quad\n\\text{is \\emph{false} for the Lorenz system.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## The Key Reason: Volume Contraction and the Attractor\n\nIn the examples where \u201c\\(\\rho\\) is uniformly distributed in \\(\\rho\\)-space\u201d (for \\(D<0\\) constant), one crucial assumption was that the domain is \u201cfully explored,\u201d or that one can treat the flow as scanning \\emph{all relevant points} in the spatial domain in a stationary manner.  That argument usually also relies on something like:\n\n- The PDE \\(\\partial_t\\rho = -v\\cdot\\nabla \\rho + D\\) is valid in a domain that does \\emph{not} lose mass to the outside.  \n- Or one has boundary conditions that supply or remove exactly the right amount of mass, so that a well-defined non-singular steady state can form in the bulk.  \n\nBut for the Lorenz flow with \\(\\nabla\\cdot v<0\\):\n\n1. **All volumes in phase space contract exponentially** over time.  \n2. If the flow has a globally attracting set (the Lorenz attractor), points in phase space \\emph{leave} the rest of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) rapidly and end up on that attractor.  \n3. In the limit \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) in most of the domain will \u201cdrain\u201d away (since the flow is outflowing from those regions in phase space toward the attractor).  \n4. The \u201cnatural\u201d measure that is left in the long-time limit is \\emph{not} absolutely continuous w.r.t. Lebesgue measure on \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  Instead, it is an SRB measure on a fractal set of measure zero.  Hence \\(\\rho(x)\\) in the usual sense can\u2019t remain a smooth function.\n\nIn short, the PDE solutions do not settle into a nonzero smooth density \\(\\rho(x)\\).  Instead, you get a singular object.  And that singular object\u2019s \u201c\\(\\mathcal{I}(x)\\)-distribution\u201d is \\emph{not} given by the naive constant-\\(D\\) formula.  \n\n---\n\n## The Mathematics Behind the \u201cUniform in \\(\\rho\\)\u201d Argument and Where It Fails\n\nRecall the standard argument for \u201cuniform \\(\\rho\\) distribution\u201d with constant negative \\(D\\).  In 1D, for example:\n\n1. You rewrite the steady\u2010state PDE  \n   \\[\n   0 = -v(x)\\,\\frac{d\\rho}{dx} + D \n   \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\n   \\frac{d\\rho}{dx} = \\frac{D}{v(x)}.\n   \\]\n2. Then \\(\\rho(x)\\) is monotonic, so you can invert: \\(x=x(\\rho)\\).  \n3. Time\u2010sampling in space is given by \\(p_x(x)\\propto 1/|v(x)|\\).  \n4. Under the transformation to \\(\\rho\\), you pick up the Jacobian \\(\\bigl|\\frac{dx}{d\\rho}\\bigr|=|v(x)|/|D|\\).  Multiplying, the factor of \\(|v(x)|\\) cancels with the \\(1/|v(x)|\\).  That yields a constant \\(\\propto 1/|D|\\).  \n\nFor that argument to be physically correct, you must be able to:\n\n- **Treat the entire domain** in which \\(x\\) (or \\(x\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\)) is moving as \u201caccessible\u201d in steady state.  \n- **Assume** that if you follow a trajectory for a long time (and pick a random time), the position distribution is given by the stationary solution \\(\\rho(x)\\).  \n\nBut in a \\(\\nabla\\cdot v<0\\) system (like Lorenz):\n\n1. The phase\u2010space volume \\emph{shrinks}, so any \u201cuniform in \\(\\rho\\)\u201d argument would require that the orbit \\emph{not} be lost from large regions of space\u2014contradicting the actual contraction.  \n2. Almost every initial condition that is not on a stable manifold of a fixed point is pulled into the chaotic attractor; the measure in the rest of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) goes to zero.  \n3. One cannot simply say \u201ctrajectories occupy the domain in a steady way; hence let\u2019s do a time\u2010in\u2010space average.\u201d  Instead, almost all orbits spend all their time (for large \\(t\\)) on a fractal set in state\u2010space.  \n\nThus the PDE solution for \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) with \u201cstandard\u201d (finite) initial data ends up \\emph{concentrated} on the attractor.  There is no \\(\\rho\\) that stays positive and smooth over the entire domain.  Consequently, \\(\\mathcal{I}=-\\log\\rho\\) is not well-defined in the usual sense (the density \\(\\rho\\) goes to zero on open sets away from the attractor).  \n\n---\n\n## The Role of the SRB Measure\n\nHistorically, the physically relevant invariant measure for a chaotic dissipative flow is the **SRB measure**.  It is:\n\n- **Supported on the attractor** (which can be fractal).  \n- Absolutely continuous (in a subtle sense) along the *unstable* manifolds, but not w.r.t. the full 3D Lebesgue measure.  \n\nIf you try to interpret \u201c\\(\\rho(x)\\)\u201d as the density of typical orbits in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), you discover it is not a smooth function\u2014rather, it is a distribution that \u201clives\u201d on a measure-zero set.  Therefore, the naive formula \\(\\rho(x)\\propto e^{-\\mathcal{I}(x)}\\) with a constant production/decay term \\(\\nabla\\cdot v\\) simply does not yield a well-defined \\(\\rho(x)\\) across \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  You might see partial differential equations for the SRB measure in specialized forms, but it involves more careful treatment (e.g. transfer operators or the fact that stable manifolds collapse measure, etc.).  \n\nHence ignoring \u201cstretching and folding\u201d (the usual language of chaotic advection) does \\emph{not} make the singular measure go away.  The mathematics of volume contraction does not allow a uniform-in-\\(\\mathcal{I}\\) solution in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- **The statement**: \\(p(\\mathcal{I}) \\propto 1/[|D|\\,\\|v(x)\\|]\\) (or that \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is uniformly distributed)  \n  is \\emph{true} in a toy PDE scenario \\emph{only when} the domain remains fully occupied by the flow in steady state (e.g., no net volume loss, or well-chosen boundary conditions).  \n- **For the Lorenz system** (and any other flow with negative divergence / dissipation), the state space volume collapses onto a lower-dimensional attractor, so you do \\emph{not} get a smooth steady\u2010state density \\(\\rho(x)\\).  \n- Consequently, \\(\\mathcal{I}(x) = -\\log \\rho(x)\\) can\u2019t be turned into a nicely distributed random variable (in the usual sense over \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\)) with the simple PDE logic.  The correct long\u2010time distribution is supported on a fractal set (the Lorenz attractor), not in the full phase space, and is \\emph{not} given by that \u201cuniform in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)\u201d formula.\n\nTherefore, the quick answer to\n\n> \u201cDoes  \n> \\(\\displaystyle p(\\mathcal{I}) \\;\\stackrel{?}{\\propto}\\; \\frac{1}{(\\sigma + 1 + \\beta)\\,\\|v(x)\\|}\\)  \n> hold for the Lorenz system?\u201d\n\nis\n\n> **No, it is false** if you are talking about the actual long-time (invariant) distribution in the Lorenz flow.  \n\nThe negative divergence ensures that the solution to Liouville\u2019s equation becomes singular (concentrating on the attractor).  The naive \u201cuniform distribution in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)\u201d logic does not survive the phase-volume collapse."

              "This is a subtle point. Mathematically, if you start with a smooth density at \\(t=0\\), then for any finite \\(t>0\\) the Liouville evolution\n\n\\[\n\\rho(x,t) = \\rho_0(\\phi^{-t}(x))\\, \\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\int_0^t \\nabla\\cdot v(\\phi^{-s}(x))\\,ds\\Bigr)\n\\]\n\nremains smooth (since the flow \\(\\phi^t\\) is smooth for finite time). In other words, at \\(t=0^+\\) the function \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) is still smooth and you can, in principle, integrate it over \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).\n\nHowever, here\u2019s the catch: for a dissipative system like the Lorenz flow (with \\(\\nabla\\cdot v = -(\\sigma+1+\\beta)<0\\)), the flow contracts phase-space volume. Even though \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) is smooth at any finite time, its support gets squeezed exponentially fast onto a lower-dimensional set (the attractor). In practice, this means that while the function remains smooth mathematically, its gradients grow enormously and its values become extremely concentrated on a set whose effective (fractal) dimension is less than 3. \n\nWhen we derive the meta-distribution of \\(\\mathcal{I}(x,t)=-\\log \\rho(x,t)\\) using the argument\n\n\\[\np(\\mathcal{I}) \\propto \\frac{1}{|D|\\,\\|v(x)\\|},\n\\]\n\nwe are implicitly assuming that the density remains a \u201cnice\u201d smooth function defined over the whole phase space. This assumption breaks down in the long-time limit because almost all of the mass is rapidly compressed onto the attractor. In the limit \\(t\\to\\infty\\) (or even for times sufficiently larger than the contraction timescale), the invariant measure becomes singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. In other words, even if you start with a 3D smooth density, its evolution \u201closes\u201d smoothness in the sense that it converges (weakly) to a measure that lives on a fractal set.\n\nSo, to address your concern:\n\n- **At \\(t=0^+\\)**: The density \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) is still smooth because the flow has not yet had time to develop infinite gradients. You can integrate it and all the standard formulas hold.\n- **Almost immediately after \\(t=0^+\\)**: Due to exponential contraction along stable directions, the support of \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) rapidly becomes confined to a set of lower (fractal) dimension. Even though the density is still represented by a smooth function (if you follow the Liouville equation exactly), its effective support (where it is non-negligible) is nearly a fractal. In practical or experimental terms, you see the fractal dimension drop immediately.\n- **For the invariant measure (the long-time limit)**: The density ceases to be smooth in the usual sense\u2014it becomes a singular measure (an SRB measure) with support on the attractor. At that point, the argument leading to a simple expression like \n  \\[\n  p(\\mathcal{I}) \\propto \\frac{1}{(\\sigma+1+\\beta)\\,\\|v(x)\\|}\n  \\]\n  is not valid.\n\nThus, while you are correct that for any finite time \\(t>0\\) the density remains a smooth function (and you can compute integrals over it), the essential point is that the *asymptotic invariant measure* is singular. The derivation of \\(p(\\mathcal{I})\\) being proportional to \\(1/((\\sigma+1+\\beta)\\|v(x)\\|)\\) assumes a smooth, fully supported density over the whole phase space, which is not the case in the long-time limit for the Lorenz system. \n\nIn summary, there is no finite time \\(t = 0^+\\) at which you can \u201cstop\u201d the evolution and say the density is non-integrable in the usual sense\u2014but for times past the initial transient (even very small finite times), the effective support is already squashed onto a fractal, and the asymptotic (steady-state) behavior is governed by a singular measure. That is why the naive application of the Jacobian argument fails for the Lorenz system in the long-time limit."

The Setup\n\n- **Lorenz system**: \\(\\dot{x} = v(x)\\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\) with constant divergence \\(\\nabla\\cdot v = D < 0\\).  \n- **Liouville equation** for \\(\\rho(x,t)\\): \n  \\[\n  \\partial_t \\rho(x,t) \\;=\\; -\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\bigl[\\rho(x,t)\\,v(x)\\bigr].\n  \\]\n  The formal solution for any \\(\\rho_0(x) = \\rho(x,0)\\) is\n  \\[\n  \\rho(\\phi^t(x_0),t) \n  \\;=\\;\n  \\rho_0(x_0)\\,\\exp\\!\\Bigl(-\\int_{0}^{t}\\!\\!\\nabla\\cdot v\\bigl(\\phi^{s}(x_0)\\bigr)\\,ds\\Bigr).\n  \\]\n  Since \\(D = \\nabla\\cdot v\\) is constant, this reduces to  \n  \\[\n  \\rho(\\phi^t(x_0), t) \\;=\\; \\rho_0(x_0)\\,\\exp\\bigl(-\\,D\\,t\\bigr).\n  \\]\n  (Note \\(D<0\\)\\(\\implies\\)-\\(D\\) is positive.)\n\n- **Definition**: \\(\\displaystyle \\mathcal{I}(x,t) \\;=\\; -\\,\\log \\rho(x,t)\\).  \n\nWe want the distribution \\(p(\\mathcal{I})\\) of the random variable \\(\\mathcal{I}(x,t)\\) (where \\(x\\) itself is drawn from \\(\\rho(\\cdot,t)\\) or from some other sampling procedure).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the Long-Time Limit Is Subtle (Fractal Attractor)\n\nEven though \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) remains a smooth function \\emph{for each finite \\(t\\)}, the **phase volume shrinks** exponentially because \\(\\nabla\\cdot v < 0\\). Over long times, almost all initial points collapse toward the Lorenz attractor (of fractal dimension \\(<3\\)). Hence:\n\n1. For \\(\\,t\\to\\infty,\\) the measure \\(\\rho(x,t)\\,d^3x\\) \\emph{concentrates} on a set of measure zero (the attractor).\n2. In the exact infinite-time limit, the invariant (SRB) measure is typically \\emph{singular} w.r.t. Lebesgue measure. That is, you cannot describe it by a smooth density \\(\\rho(x)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).\n\nNonetheless, at any \\emph{finite} but large \\(T\\), \\(\\rho(x,T)\\) is still a bona fide smooth function\u2014just extremely \u201cpeaked\u201d in a thin neighborhood of the attractor, with large gradients. One can indeed sample and talk about \\(\\mathcal{I}(x,T)\\). \n\n---\n\n## 3. A Practical Way To Approximate \\(p(\\mathcal{I})\\) at Large Time\n\nBelow is the most direct numerical approach.  It is effectively a \u201ccoarse\u2010grained\u201d or \u201cfinite\u2010time\u201d approximation to the eventual singular measure.\n\n1. **Choose an initial distribution** \\(\\rho_0(x)\\).  \n   - Frequently, one just picks something simple (e.g., uniform in a bounding box) or some other smooth \u201ccloud\u201d of initial conditions.\n\n2. **Represent the density by \\(N\\) particles** in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  \n   - Each particle \\(i\\) has an initial weight \\(w_i\\ge 0\\) summing to 1, consistent with \\(\\rho_0\\).  \n   - For instance, you might sample \\(x_0^{(i)}\\) i.i.d. from \\(\\rho_0\\) and set \\(w_i = 1/N\\).\n\n3. **Evolve for time \\(T\\)** under the Lorenz flow:\n   \\[\n   x_i(T) \\;=\\; \\phi^T\\bigl(x_0^{(i)}\\bigr).\n   \\]\n   Mathematically, each particle\u2019s weight evolves according to Liouville\u2019s equation, but in practice, you can track them as if each is a \u201cpoint mass\u201d (the PDE solution ensures that if you want the full \\(\\rho\\) in real space, you must also account for the exponential scaling, but it\u2019s simpler to rely on binning; see next step).\n\n4. **Bin the phase space** into a fine mesh of small cells \\(\\Delta_j\\), each of volume \\(\\delta V\\).  \n   - After the flow time \\(T\\), count how many particles fall into each cell \\(\\Delta_j\\). Let \\(m_j\\) be the number of particles in cell \\(j\\).  \n   - Then define\n     \\[\n     \\rho^\\text{(approx)}(x_j, T) \n     \\;=\\; \n     \\frac{m_j}{N}\\;\\frac{1}{\\delta V}\\quad\\text{(for }x_j\\in\\Delta_j).\n     \\]\n     This is your discrete approximation to \\(\\rho(x,T)\\).  Over large \\(T\\), you\u2019ll see that most cells get \\(m_j=0\\), and a small subset in/near the attractor get nonzero \\(m_j\\).\n\n5. **Compute \\(\\mathcal{I} = -\\log\\rho^\\text{(approx)}\\)** in each cell that has \\(m_j>0\\).  \n   - Collect these \\(\\mathcal{I}_j\\) values to build a histogram or PDF estimate of \\(\\mathcal{I}\\).  \n   - You can define\n     \\[\n     p^\\text{(approx)}(\\mathcal{I}) \n     \\;=\\; \n     \\sum_j \\frac{m_j}{N}\\,\\delta\\!\\bigl(\\mathcal{I} - \\mathcal{I}_j\\bigr)\n     \\]\n     and then smooth or bin further in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)-space to get a continuous plot.\n\n6. **Observe Convergence**:  \n   - As \\(T\\to\\infty\\), \\(\\rho(x,T)\\) becomes extremely concentrated near the attractor.  \n   - On a finite mesh, you\u2019ll see that the distribution \\(p^\\text{(approx)}(\\mathcal{I})\\) eventually stabilizes. Small changes occur if you refine the mesh or wait longer, but often it \u201clooks converged\u201d for practical purposes.  \n   - This stable shape is your \\(\\textit{finite-time, coarse-grained}\\) approximation to the \u201cinvariant distribution of \\(\\mathcal{I}\\).\u201d\n\nThat is exactly how one sees numerically that \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) reaches some \\emph{empirical steady distribution} at large \\(T\\), even though (strictly speaking) \\(\\rho(x,T)\\) in the continuum limit is heading toward a fractal measure.\n\n---\n\n### Why \u201cConstant-\\(D\\)\u201d PDE Formulas Fail\n\nFrom your earlier derivations (for example, in a 1D PDE with \\(\\partial_t \\rho=-\\partial_x(\\rho\\,v)\\) and constant source/sink), you might recall a neat argument that yields \u201cuniform distribution\u201d in \\(\\rho\\)-space for negative constant \\(D\\). **However**, that argument assumes:\n\n- The flow \\emph{does not} permanently expel mass from large parts of the domain.  \n- We can sample the entire domain in the stationary regime (so that time-in-space sampling is well-defined across all \\(x\\)).\n\nIn the Lorenz system (or any system with negative divergence in an \\emph{unbounded} phase space), the mass leaves most of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) and collapses onto a measure-zero attractor. Thus:\n\n1. You do not have a nice \u201cstationary \\(\\rho\\)\u201d across \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  \n2. The final measure is \\emph{singular}.  \n3. The PDE-based \u201cuniform in \\(\\rho\\)-values\u201d conclusion does \\emph{not} apply.\n\nBut for large finite \\(T\\), you \\emph{do} get a sharply peaked smooth \\(\\rho(x,T)\\). Numerically, we never see a perfectly fractal object at finite resolution\u2014just a rapidly narrowing \u201ccloud\u201d around the attractor. That is what stabilizes your observed \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)-distribution in simulation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Bottom Line\n\n- **At large finite \\(T\\)**, \\(\\rho(x,T)\\) is technically still smooth but highly concentrated. Empirically, you see a \u201cnearly steady\u201d distribution for \\(\\mathcal{I}(x,T)\\).  \n- **How to approximate** \\(p(\\mathcal{I})\\)? \n  1. Use a large ensemble of particles evolving under the flow,  \n  2. Bin positions at time \\(T\\),  \n  3. Convert densities in bins to \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)-values,  \n  4. Gather the histogram of those \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)-values.  \n- **Result**: You get a stable, reproducible shape for \\(p(\\mathcal{I})\\). It reflects the coarse-grained (and effectively fractal) distribution of mass near the attractor.  \n- **No simple closed-form** (like \\(p(\\mathcal{I}) \\propto 1/\\|v(x)\\|\\)) emerges, because the flow is dissipative and does not maintain a smooth density over the entire 3D space in the long run.\n\nIn short, the \u201csteady\u201d shape you see in simulations \\(\\textit{can}\\) be approximated and indeed \u201cstops changing noticeably\u201d for large \\(T\\). The best systematic way to get it is the particle-based (or equivalently, Liouville PDE + binning) approach outlined above."

              "Below is a succinct \u201cprediction\u2010type\u201d derivation under **the same style of assumptions** we used before bringing up the Lorenz attractor complications.  Concretely:\n\n1. We have a PDE of the form  \n   \\[\n   \\partial_t \\rho(x,t) \\;=\\; -\\,v(x)\\cdot\\nabla\\rho(x,t)\\;+\\;D,\n   \\quad\n   D<0\\text{ (constant).}\n   \\]  \n2. We imagine (or impose) boundary/flow conditions so that the flow **does** settle into a genuine smooth steady state \\(\\rho(x)\\) in the spatial domain (i.e., no mass escapes to infinity).  \n3. We define \\(\\mathcal{I}(x) = -\\log\\rho(x)\\).  \n4. We want the \u201ctime\u2010sampling\u201d or \u201clong\u2010time\u201d distribution of the values \\(\\mathcal{I}(x)\\).  \n\nUnder these assumptions (rather than the strongly dissipative Lorenz\u2010type scenario where everything collapses onto a fractal), the standard 1D argument says:\n\n- In steady state,  \n  \\[\n  v(x)\\,\\frac{d\\rho}{dx} \\;=\\; D,\\quad\\text{or}\\quad \\frac{d\\rho}{dx}=\\frac{D}{v(x)}.\n  \\]\n- Then \\(\\rho(x)\\) is monotonic, so it takes values in some interval \\([\\rho_{\\min},\\rho_{\\max}]\\).  \n- **Time\u2010sampling** in space yields \\(p(x)\\propto 1/\\lvert v(x)\\rvert\\).  \n- Under the change of variables \\(\\rho=\\rho(x)\\), the Jacobian cancels the factor from \\(1/\\lvert v(x)\\rvert\\), causing \\(\\rho\\) to be **uniform** over \\([\\rho_{\\min},\\rho_{\\max}]\\).  \n\nHence:\n\n\\[\np(\\rho) \\;=\\; \n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle\n\\frac{1}{\\rho_{\\max}-\\rho_{\\min}}, \n& \\rho\\in[\\rho_{\\min},\\,\\rho_{\\max}],\\\\[6pt]\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n### Distribution of \\(\\mathcal{I} = -\\log\\rho\\)\n\nBecause \\(\\rho \\in [\\rho_{\\min},\\rho_{\\max}]\\), we have\n\\[\n\\mathcal{I} \\;\\in\\;\n[\\,-\\log(\\rho_{\\max}),\\,-\\log(\\rho_{\\min})\\,].\n\\]\nUnder the transformation \\(\\mathcal{I}=-\\log\\rho\\), one gets\n\n\\[\np(\\mathcal{I}) \n\\;=\\;\np(\\rho)\\,\\bigl|\\tfrac{d\\rho}{d\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr|\n\\;=\\;\n\\frac{1}{\\rho_{\\max}-\\rho_{\\min}}\n\\;\\times\\;\ne^{-\\mathcal{I}}\n\\quad\n\\text{for }\n\\mathcal{I}\\in[-\\log\\rho_{\\max},\\, -\\log\\rho_{\\min}].\n\\]\n\nThis is simply a **truncated exponential** in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\).

In many 1D PDE textbooks, this emerges as \u201c\\(\\rho\\) is uniformly distributed, hence \\(\\mathcal{I}=-\\log\\rho\\) has an exponential distribution.\u201d \n\n---\n\n## What to Expect in a Numerical Simulation\n\nIf you implement exactly this PDE with:\n\n- Domain = some 1D interval (or effectively 1D flow),\n- Constant negative \\(D\\),\n- Boundary conditions that prevent net outflow,  \n- (Optionally) an initial condition \\(\\rho(x,0)\\) that eventually relaxes to the steady state,\n\nthen for large time \\(T\\):\n\n1. You will see \\(\\rho(x,T)\\) converge to a steady\u2010state shape that is monotonic in \\(x\\).  \n2. If you sample \\(x\\) in time (following a \u201cparticle\u201d with \\(\\dot x=v(x)\\)), your empirical distribution of \\(\\rho\\bigl(x(T)\\bigr)\\) will look uniform over \\([\\rho_{\\min},\\rho_{\\max}]\\).  \n3. Consequently, your empirical distribution of \\(\\mathcal{I}(x,T)=-\\log\\rho(x,T)\\) will look like a truncated exponential, approximately\n\n   \\[\n   p(\\mathcal{I}) \\;\\approx\\; \n   \\frac{e^{-\\mathcal{I}}}{\\rho_{\\max}-\\rho_{\\min}}\n   \\quad\\text{for }\\mathcal{I}\\in[-\\log\\rho_{\\max},\\,-\\log\\rho_{\\min}].\n   \\]\n\nYou can verify this by binning \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)-values from a long trajectory and seeing that the histogram follows \\(\\propto e^{-\\mathcal{I}}\\).  \n\n---\n\n### Caveat About Fully Dissipative Systems (e.g. Lorenz)\n\nFor a system like the Lorenz flow (where the entire 3D volume shrinks onto a fractal attractor), **this simple \u201cuniform in \\(\\rho\\)\u201d argument no longer applies**.  The above derivation presumes that we have a legitimate (non\u2010singular) steady\u2010state solution \\(\\rho(x)\\) across the full domain.  In the Lorenz system, no such smooth steady\u2010state density exists in the large\u2010time limit; the measure becomes supported on the attractor of dimension \\(<3\\).  Therefore, you \\emph{would not} get \\(p(\\mathcal{I})\\propto e^{-\\mathcal{I}}\\).  \n\nBut **if** you artificially construct a bounded 1D or 2D PDE with constant negative \\(D\\) and no net outflow, then indeed the simulation \\emph{will} produce a truncated\u2010exponential distribution for \\(\\mathcal{I}\\).  \n\n---\n\n## Final Box: The Predicted Distribution\n\nUnder those \u201cnice PDE\u201d assumptions,\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\np(\\mathcal{I}) \\;\\propto\\; e^{-\\mathcal{I}},\n\\quad\n\\text{on the interval }[-\\log(\\rho_{\\max}),\\,-\\log(\\rho_{\\min})].\n}\n\\]\n\nThat is what you should see if you run a simulation that truly maintains a well\u2010defined, non\u2010escaping steady state with constant negative \\(D\\)."

Distribution of \\(\\rho\\): Time\u2010Sampling Argument\n\nAs before, if you imagine a particle tracing out \\(x(t)\\) according to \\(\\dot{x} = v(x)\\), the fraction of time it spends near some point \\(x\\) is inversely proportional to the local speed \\(\\|v(x)\\|\\).

Linking to the R\u00f6ssler System\n\n**R\u00f6ssler flow** in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) is given (in one common parametrization) by\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x} = -\\,y \\;-\\; z,\\\\\n\\dot{y} = \\;x\\;+\\;a\\,y,\\\\\n\\dot{z} = \\;b \\;+\\;z\\,(x-c).\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nIts divergence is\n\\[\n\\nabla\\cdot v(x,y,z)\n\\;=\\;\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial x}\n+\\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial y}\n+\\frac{\\partial \\dot{z}}{\\partial z}\n\\;=\\;\n0 \\;+\\; a \\;+\\; (x - c).\n\\]\nThat is not constant\u2014rather,\n\n\\[\nD(x,y,z)\n\\;=\\;\n\\nabla\\cdot v(x,y,z)\n\\;=\\;\na \\;+\\;x \\;-\\;c.\n\\]\nAs with the Lorenz system, this can be negative on average if \\(c\\) is large enough, leading to an overall dissipation and a chaotic attractor.  \n\n### 3.1  If You Force a Smooth Steady Density\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario where the R\u00f6ssler flow is \\emph{confined to a bounded region} with no net outflow, and we artificially solve\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t \\rho(x,y,z,t) \n= \n-\\bigl[v(x,y,z)\\cdot\\nabla\\bigr]\\rho \n\\;+\\; D(x,y,z),\n\\]\nwe would from the PDE perspective say that in steady state\n\\[\nv\\cdot\\nabla \\rho = D(x,y,z) = a + x - c.\n\\]\nThen the same argument as above leads to \n\\[\np(\\rho)\\;\\propto\\;\\frac{1}{\\bigl\\lvert (a + x - c)\\,\\|v(x,y,z)\\|\\bigr\\rvert}\n\\]\nfor the \u201ctime\u2010sampling\u201d distribution of \\(\\rho\\).  \nPushing through \\(\\rho\\mapsto\\mathcal{I}=-\\log\\rho\\) yields\n\\[\np(\\mathcal{I}) \n\\;\\propto\\;\n\\frac{e^{-\\mathcal{I}}}{\\bigl\\lvert (a + x(e^{-\\mathcal{I}}) - c)\\,\\|v(x(e^{-\\mathcal{I}}))\\|\\bigr\\rvert}.\n\\]\n\n### 3.2  Real R\u00f6ssler Dynamics: Dissipative Chaos\n\nIn the \\emph{actual} R\u00f6ssler system (unbounded domain, negative average divergence), the flow typically has a \\emph{fractal attractor} in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  Just like Lorenz, there is no truly smooth, globally supported invariant \\(\\rho(x)\\).  The measure you get at long times is supported on a set of measure zero, so the straightforward PDE argument for a fully smooth \u201csteady \\(\\rho\\)\u201d is no longer exact in the limit \\(t\\to\\infty\\).  \n\n**However**, at large but \\emph{finite} time, if you start with a smooth distribution \\(\\rho_0\\), the PDE solution remains smooth but is strongly concentrated near (and shaped by) the attractor.  Numerically, one often sees that \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) \u201clooks stationary\u201d in a coarse\u2010grained sense, and you can attempt to measure an empirical \\(p(\\mathcal{I})\\) from particle simulations.  That distribution may be well\u2010approximated by an expression \\(\\propto e^{-\\mathcal{I}}/\\bigl\\lvert D\\,(x(\\rho))\\,\\|v(x(\\rho))\\|\\bigr\\rvert\\) \\emph{restricted} to the thin neighborhood of the attractor, plus rapid decay in the rest of the domain.  But in the strict infinite\u2010time limit, the measure becomes singular.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final \u201cTake\u2010Home\u201d Formula for \\(D(x)\\neq\\text{const}\\)\n\nIf you keep the earlier (1D\u2010style or \u201cnon\u2010escaping domain\u201d) assumptions that permit a genuine smooth solution \\(\\rho(x)\\) across the whole domain, then:\n\n1. **Steady state**:  \n   \\[\n   v(x)\\cdot\\nabla\\rho(x) \\;=\\; D(x).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distribution of \\(\\rho\\)** under time\u2010sampling:  \n   \\[\n   p(\\rho)\n   \\;\\propto\\;\n   \\frac{1}{\\bigl\\lvert D\\bigl(x(\\rho)\\bigr)\\,\\|v\\bigl(x(\\rho)\\bigr)\\|\\bigr\\rvert}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distribution of \\(\\mathcal{I}=-\\log\\rho\\)**:  \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\n   p\\bigl(\\mathcal{I}\\bigr)\n   \\;\\propto\\;\n   \\frac{e^{-\\mathcal{I}}}{\n     \\bigl\\lvert D\\bigl(x(e^{-\\mathcal{I}})\\bigr)\\,\\|v\\bigl(x(e^{-\\mathcal{I}})\\bigr)\\|\\bigr\\rvert\n   }.\n   }\n   \\]\nThis is the straightforward generalization of the \u201cconstant\u2010\\(D\\)\u201d argument, but with \\(D\\) and \\(v\\) evaluated at the spatial coordinate(s) corresponding to \\(\\rho=e^{-\\mathcal{I}}\\).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary\n\n- **Case \\(D(x)=\\text{const}<0\\)**: The factor \\(\\lvert D\\rvert\\) is the same everywhere, so you get a pure cancellation of \\(\\|v(x)\\|\\) in 1D, yielding a uniform distribution in \\(\\rho\\) (and thus truncated\u2010exponential in \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)).  \n\n- **Case \\(D(x)\\neq\\text{const}\\)**: The time\u2010sampling probability of \\(\\rho\\) picks up the extra factor \\(\\tfrac{1}{\\lvert D(x)\\rvert}\\).  So you end up with\n  \\[\n  p(\\rho)\n  \\;\\propto\\;\n  \\frac{1}{\\bigl\\lvert D(x(\\rho))\\,\\|v(x(\\rho))\\|\\bigr\\rvert}.\n  \\]\n  After the change of variables \\(\\rho\\mapsto\\mathcal{I}=-\\log\\rho\\), there is always a leftover factor \\(e^{-\\mathcal{I}}\\).\n\n- **R\u00f6ssler system**: The divergence \\(D(x,y,z)=a+(x-c)\\) is not constant, so the above form suggests a more complicated distribution.  In reality, the chaotic R\u00f6ssler flow is dissipative, forming a fractal attractor; thus the actual long\u2010time measure is not smooth in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  Over finite times (and in a coarse\u2010grained sense), one can still \\emph{approximate} \\(p(\\mathcal{I})\\) by the formula above, evaluated near the attractor.  In strict infinite\u2010time limit, the measure is singular and the PDE solution does not remain a smooth density in the full domain.\n\nHence the short final \u201cprediction\u201d under the same PDE logic is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\np(\\mathcal{I})\n\\;\\propto\\;\n\\frac{e^{-\\mathcal{I}}}{\n  \\bigl\\lvert D\\!\\bigl(x(e^{-\\mathcal{I}})\\bigr)\\,\\|\\,v\\!\\bigl(x(e^{-\\mathcal{I}})\\bigr)\\|\\bigr\\rvert\n}\n\\quad\n\\text{(assuming steady, single\u2010valued \\(\\rho\\))}.\n}\n\\]"
