              "**Evaluating code calculation**\n\nThe code seems to be trying to compute the probability density of a Gaussian random variable for \"diffs,\" but the ambiguity lies in how it's being computed. It uses a 1D normal distribution formula time for each vector of size HxW. The formula `p0 = 1/(std * sqrt(2 pi)) * exp(-0.5 * sum(diff^2) / std^2)` appears to be applied as if it\u2019s a 1D normal distribution. This is likely not exactly what the user is looking for since the vectors are 2D, not 1D.\n\n**Assessing the density calculation**\n\nThe original code uses a univariate Gaussian normalization constant when it should account for the dimensionality of the \"diffs\" vector, which is HxW. Since we're dealing with multiple dimensions here, the normalization factor should be adjusted to `(1/(std * sqrt(2*pi)))^(H*W)` instead of just `1/(std * sqrt(2*pi))`. This code only works for 1D \"diffs\" (i.e., when H*W = 1). If H and W are greater than 1, the calculation will be incorrect unless we use the correct multivariate normalization factor."

              "**Thinking about normalization stability**\n\nOkay, so the user seems worried about the huge number when trying to compute the normalization constant with large H and W values. The formula calculates something pretty big because of the exponent, so I think computing the log probability might be a better approach. If I calculate the log probability, it becomes much easier: log probability = -n * log(std * sqrt(2 * pi)) - 0.5 * (diffs**2).sum(dim=(-2,-1)) / std**2. Then, if I need the actual probability, I can exponentiate it.\n\n**Considering log domain computation**\n\nIt seems like computing the probability directly can lead to extremely small values, especially with large H and W. To avoid problems like underflow, I'd suggest computing in the log domain. The log probability would be:\n\n`log_p0 = -H*W * torch.log(std * np.sqrt(2*np.pi)) - 0.5 * (diffs**2).sum(dim=(-2,-1)) / std**2`.\n\nThen, if necessary, I can exponentiate to get the actual probability, `p0 = torch.exp(log_p0)`. But it's often better to use log probabilities for stability."

              "First, let\u2019s restate the problem in general terms: you have a time-dependent field \\(A(x,t)\\in \\mathbb{R}\\), and its evolution is given by a PDE (or \u201cflow\u201d)\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t A(x,t) \\;=\\; f[A](x) \\,,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(f\\) is some functional of \\(A\\). You also have a probability density \\(p[A,t]\\) over the space of fields \\(A(x)\\), and you want to track how \\(\\log p[A,t]\\) changes in time.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The usual finite-dimensional analogy\n\nIn finite dimensions, suppose you have a vector \\(\\mathbf{z}(t)\\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) evolving by \n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{z}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z},t).\n\\]\n\nIf you consider a time-dependent probability density \\(p(\\mathbf{z}, t)\\), you often see that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\bigl[\\log p(\\mathbf{z},t)\\bigr] \\;=\\; -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{z}}\\cdot \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z},t)\\;=\\; -\\sum_{i=1}^d \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial z_i}.\n\\]\n\nThe key term here is the **divergence** of the flow \\(\\mathbf{f}\\). In log-probability space, it shows up with a negative sign:\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t \\log p(\\mathbf{z},t) = -\\,\\mathrm{div}(\\mathbf{f}).\n\\]\n\nNo extra factor of \\(1/d\\) appears in front of the divergence; we simply sum over (or take the trace over) all dimensions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The infinite-dimensional (functional) case\n\nWhen you move to a field \\(A(x)\\) defined on some domain (let\u2019s call it \\(\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\)), the analogous statement involves a **functional** divergence. Formally, one writes:\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t \\log p[A,t] \\;=\\; \n-\\,\\text{div}_{A}\\!\\bigl(f[A]\\bigr)\n\\;=\\; -\\,\\int_{\\Omega}\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A(x)}\\,dx,\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A(x)}\n\\]\n\nis the **functional derivative** of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(A\\).  \n\n1. We replace the finite-dimensional sum \\(\\sum_{i=1}^d \\partial f_i/\\partial z_i\\) by an integral \\(\\int \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A(x)} \\,dx\\).  \n2. There is still **no** factor of \\(1/\\dim\\) or \\(1/|\\Omega|\\) that automatically appears unless you specifically define your divergence operator that way.  \n3. The measure in the definition of your probability density might add other factors (e.g., if your space is discretized to \\(H\\times W\\) points), but the standard definition of the functional divergence is simply the integral of the functional derivative.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Discretizing the field (e.g., \\(H\\times W\\) grid)\n\nIf you discretize your field \\(A(x)\\) on a grid of size \\((H\\times W)\\), then \\(A\\) is effectively a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{H\\cdot W}\\). The flow becomes\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t A_{i,j} = f_{i,j}(\\{A_{m,n}\\}),\n\\]\n\nand the divergence is (in the discrete sense)\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^H \\sum_{j=1}^W \\frac{\\partial f_{i,j}}{\\partial A_{i,j}}.\n\\]\n\nAgain, this sum is the direct discrete analog of \\(\\int \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A}\\,dx\\). No factor like \\(1/(H\\times W)\\) appears unless **you** decide to define it that way (for instance, if you were defining an *average* divergence rather than the total divergence). \n\nHence, from a standard measure-theoretic or PDE standpoint, you do **not** typically divide by \\(H \\times W\\). The correct \u201cJacobian-trace\u201d term (or \u201cdivergence\u201d in the PDE sense) is simply the sum (or integral) of the partial derivatives.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Integrating in time to get \\(-\\log p[A]\\)\n\nYou mentioned that when you integrate over time, you end up with something like:\n\n\\[\n-\\log p[A(x,t),t] \n= \n\\int_0^t \\!\\!\\int_{\\Omega}\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A(x,\\tau)}\\,dx\\,d\\tau \\;+\\; \\bigl[-\\log p[A(x,0),0]\\bigr].\n\\]\n\n- The boundary term \\(\\log p[A(x,0),0]\\) is the log-probability of your initial condition (the part you said \u201cwe already computed,\u201d e.g. the log density of a Gaussian prior on the field).\n- The integral \\(\\int \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A(x,\\tau)}\\,dx\\,d\\tau\\) does **not** have any extra normalization like \\(\\tfrac{1}{H\\times W}\\) unless you specifically want an average. Mathematically, the total (functional) divergence accumulates without being divided by the dimension of the space.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\n**Short answer**: No, you generally do **not** divide by \\(H \\times W\\) (or by the measure of \\(\\Omega\\)) when you form the integral \\(\\int \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A} \\, dx\\). \n\nThat integral **is** the correct functional-analog of the divergence (i.e., the trace of the Jacobian in an infinite-dimensional space). Introducing a factor of \\(1/(H\\cdot W)\\) would correspond to computing the *average* divergence rather than the total divergence. Unless you have a specific reason for wanting the average (like in some normalized or per-pixel sense), you typically do not include that factor."

              "Ok now that you've figured out those two, you should be able to solve this problem.

The trajectories are evolved according to the flow \\partial_t A(x,t) = f[A](x). The initial distribution is a white noise gaussian about a hand picked mean field A_0(x) and std = 0.1. I have already calculated this and achieved reasonable values experimentally.\n\nNow, I know that my system has large negative divergence so it has fractal attractors. And I know that the flow evolves towards a fractal attractor with unknown D_q spectrum. I'm wondering if I can use this knowledge of the phase space density p to determine the dimension of the attractor. The problem I'm having is the log values are still huge (on the order of -1e5), so I can't directly calculate entropy without blow up. I also am not sure if calculating entropy based on random samples is sound. Evaluate this problem and tell me some possible solutions. The goal is to measure fractal dimension, and ideally the whole spectrum of renyi dimensions D_q.\n\nWhat are my options? E.g. one thing to consider: can I simply scale -log p by a constant without effecting the entropy measurement? BTW I'm expecting small finite dimensional attractors on the order of <6. I've confirmed this with explicity correlation dimension calculations which were super expensive to run"

              "Below is a fairly detailed discussion of why your \\(\\log p\\) values blow up, how they relate to fractal dimension, and some standard options for extracting a fractal (or multifractal) dimension spectrum \\(D_q\\) from high-dimensional simulations or PDE flows.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why is \\(-\\log p\\) so large?\n\n1. **High-dimensional fields**: If you discretize your field \\(A(x)\\) on a grid of size \\(H \\times W \\ldots\\) (or larger), then the dimension \\(d\\) of the phase space is huge. Even for modest grids, \\(d\\) can be in the tens or hundreds of thousands.\n2. **Gaussian initialization**: A white-noise prior typically has a density proportional to \n   \\[\n   p(A) \\;=\\;\\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{d/2}}\\;\\exp\\Bigl(-\\tfrac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\|A - A_0\\|^2\\Bigr),\n   \\]\n   where \\(d = H \\times W \\times (\\dots)\\).  \n   - The normalization constant \\(\\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{d/2}}\\) can be *astronomically* large or small (in the log domain, it becomes \\(-\\tfrac{d}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2)\\)), hence \\(-\\log p(A)\\) can easily be on the order of \\(10^5\\) or bigger.\n3. **Flow concentration**: If your PDE/ODE flow \\(\\partial_t A = f[A]\\) continually **reduces** phase-space volume (large negative divergence), the measure collapses onto (or toward) a very low-dimensional attractor. That further drives down \\(p(A)\\) in regions away from the attractor and *raises* \\(-\\log p\\) in typical regions.\n\nThe bottom line is that large negative \\(\\log p\\) is completely expected and does not by itself prevent you from analyzing fractal structure or computing dimensional exponents. It **does** mean you have to be careful with numerical stability (e.g., always use log-probabilities instead of probabilities).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Can I just shift or scale \\(-\\log p\\) to avoid overflow?\n\n### 2.1 Shifting \\(-\\log p\\) (adding a constant)\nIf your goal is to look at *relative* entropies, free energies, or *differences* in \\(\\log p\\), then you can *always* add an overall constant shift:\n\\[\n-\\log p(A)\\;\\;\\mapsto\\;\\; -\\log p(A)\\;+\\;\\text{const.}\n\\]\nThis has **no effect** on physical or geometrical quantities that depend on *differences* of \\(\\log p\\), or on dimension estimates that are based on how \\(\\log p\\) *scales* as you zoom in. Indeed, fractal dimensions often come from local scalings and are invariant to a global additive shift in \\(\\log p\\).\n\n### 2.2 Multiplying \\(-\\log p\\) by a constant\nMultiplying \\(\\log p\\) by a constant \\(\\alpha\\) is equivalent to raising the distribution to a power, \\(p(A) \\mapsto p(A)^\\alpha\\). That **does** change the measure in a nontrivial way (it is related to **R\u00e9nyi measures** if you re-normalize). So if you want a *true* Shannon entropy or a physically correct volume measure, a multiplicative rescaling of \\(\\log p\\) will *not* preserve the original distribution. However, certain fractal dimension calculations (like generalized dimensions \\(D_q\\)) *can* involve systematically raising \\(p\\) to powers, so there *are* contexts where you do something akin to that\u2014but you then have to re-normalize and interpret it as a different *q-weighted measure*.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Measuring fractal (multifractal) dimension\n\nIt sounds like you want the dimension \\(D_1\\) (information dimension) or the full Renyi spectrum \\(D_q\\). These measure how the *invariant measure* (here, \\(\\mu(A) = p(A)\\) for the asymptotic/stationary distribution) concentrates on a fractal set (the attractor). Formally, for multifractal analysis, you look at how \n\\[\n\\int \\mu(A)^q \\,dA\n\\]\nscales with system size, or equivalently how \\(\\log p\\) scales on local neighborhoods. In practice, there are several approaches:\n\n1. **Direct correlation dimension** \\(\\hat{D}_2\\) from time-series data (the Grassberger\u2013Procaccia approach). You compute the correlation integral\n   \\[\n   C(r) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{N(N-1)}\\sum_{i\\neq j} \\Theta\\bigl(r - \\|A_i - A_j\\|\\bigr),\n   \\]\n   then see how \\(C(r)\\sim r^{D_2}\\) as \\(r\\to 0\\).  \n   - **Pro**: Very direct and well-known.  \n   - **Con**: As you note, it can be *extremely* expensive in large dimensions or large \\(N\\) ( \\(\\mathcal{O}(N^2)\\) complexity).  \n\n2. **Box-counting or grid-based methods**: Try to partition the (sub)space adaptively, measure \\(\\mu(\\text{box})\\), and see how it scales with the box size. For fractal attractors with dimension \\(\\ll d\\), you might do an adaptive partition (like k-d trees or density-based spatial partitioning).  \n   - **Pro**: Conceptually straightforward if dimension is small.  \n   - **Con**: In high dimension, naive box-counting is often infeasible, and you need very large data sets to fill boxes.\n\n3. **Local dimension / local scaling**: For each sample \\(A_i\\), estimate how the measure in a ball around \\(A_i\\) scales with radius:\n   \\[\n   \\mu\\bigl(B(A_i, r)\\bigr) \\;\\sim\\; r^{d_{\\text{loc}}(A_i)},\n   \\]\n   or equivalently,\n   \\[\n   d_{\\text{loc}}(A_i) \\;=\\;\\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{\\log \\mu[B(A_i,r)]}{\\log r}.\n   \\]\n   Then you can combine these local exponents to get *multifractal* spectra \\(D_q\\).  \n   - **Pro**: This is the standard \u201cpointwise dimension\u201d approach in multifractal analysis.  \n   - **Con**: Again can be expensive, and you need enough data in local neighborhoods.\n\n4. **Lyapunov dimension or Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension**: If your PDE or ODE system is known to have a certain set of Lyapunov exponents, you can sometimes compute the *Kaplan\u2013Yorke formula* to get an upper bound or exact value for the (information) dimension of the strange attractor.  \n   - **Pro**: Often simpler than measuring the measure directly.  \n   - **Con**: Requires a chaotic-dynamics viewpoint, plus the tangent-flow approach to compute Lyapunov exponents (which can also be expensive, but sometimes less so than huge correlation integrals).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Entropy vs. dimension\n\n- **Shannon entropy**: \n  \\[\n  S = -\\int p(A)\\log p(A)\\, dA\n  \\]\n  can blow up (or be very large negative log-likelihoods) in high-dimensional systems. Normalizing or shifting \\(\\log p\\) might help with stability, but does *not* change the actual value of \\(S\\). If you want a physically meaningful Shannon entropy, you need the *true* (unshifted) measure in the integral\u2014though practically you always compute in log-domain and exponentiate carefully at the end (if feasible).\n\n- **Fractal dimension**: \n  \\[\n  D_0, D_1, D_2, \\dots\n  \\]\n  is about the *scaling properties* of the measure. It does *not* require you to represent the entire measure with absolute precision. Typically, dimension is determined by how probabilities scale with radius (or how correlation sums scale with distance). Additive shifts in \\(\\log p\\) do *not* change the dimension at all, because dimension is about the slope in a \\(\\log(\\text{measure})\\) vs. \\(\\log(\\text{radius})\\) plot, or equivalently how \\(\\log(p(A_i))\\) changes *relatively* when you move around in state space.\n\nHence, **if your ultimate goal is dimension** rather than absolute entropy, an overall shift in \\(\\log p\\) is harmless. You only need to be sure you measure the *relative* changes in \\(\\log p\\) with respect to spatial scales in the phase space. But if you want the *actual* Shannon entropy or a direct comparison of entropies across different systems, that is more subtle.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical suggestions\n\n1. **Correlation dimension / local dimension**:  \n   - Since you already did an \u201cexplicit correlation dimension calculation,\u201d you know how expensive it is. Perhaps you can refine it or use a subset of times/states. Or you can use local dimension methods on relatively small neighborhoods if you have enough data.\n\n2. **Check Lyapunov exponents** (if feasible):  \n   - If your PDE is amenable to linearization around the trajectory, you can attempt to compute the leading Lyapunov exponents. Then a Kaplan\u2013Yorke formula might give a quick estimate of fractal dimension. This often matches correlation dimension for typical chaotic/strange attractors.\n\n3. **Multifractal box-counting with adaptive partitions**:  \n   - If you suspect the dimension is \\(\\ll d\\), you might adaptively focus your binning in the region(s) where the attractor is, ignoring empty or near-empty regions. Tools like kd-trees, vantage-point trees, or other hierarchical space-partitioning can reduce the combinatorial blowup.\n\n4. **Renormalizing \\(\\log p\\)**:  \n   - Feel free to shift \\(\\log p(A)\\mapsto \\log p(A) - \\max_A [\\log p(A)]\\) or something similar to keep it in a manageable numeric range. This is standard in many high-dimensional inference problems\u2014what matters for dimension or relative entropy is the shape of \\(\\log p\\), not its absolute offset.\n\n---\n\n### Final Takeaways\n\n- **Yes**, you can safely *add* a constant to \\(-\\log p\\) to avoid underflow or huge negative values\u2014this does *not* change fractal dimension or any geometry that depends on *relative* log-likelihoods.  \n- **No**, you typically *cannot* just multiply \\(-\\log p\\) by a constant if you want the original measure for actual entropy integrals.  \n- **For fractal dimension**\u2014which you say is your real goal\u2014the important quantity is how the measure *scales* in small neighborhoods. That scaling is invariant under global shifts in \\(\\log p\\).  \n- **Estimating the entire \\(D_q\\) spectrum** is usually done via multifractal analysis (e.g. box-counting or correlation sums raised to the power \\(q\\)). If you already suspect your dimension is < 6 (which is quite small) but your phase space dimension is huge, it means you have an *extremely thin* attractor. Methods that adapt to the data distribution (kd-tree-based correlation integrals, local dimension, or direct Lyapunov exponent methods) are typically more tractable than naive high-dimensional box counting.  \n\nIf you can harness any standard chaotic-flow or turbulence diagnostics (e.g., computing Lyapunov exponents or partial correlations in an embedded subspace), you may get to the dimension result faster than by brute-force density estimation in a huge space. But if you really want the *multifractal measure* (like the entire \\(D_q\\) spectrum) from your stored trajectories, you\u2019ll need to rely on either the correlation integral approach or an adaptive partitioning approach, both of which can be streamlined by focusing only on the regions of state space that actually get visited by the attractor.\n\nGood luck, and remember: the absolute magnitude of \\(-\\log p\\) in a high-dimensional system is not the main enemy\u2014you only need to track its *relative* structure to glean fractal dimension!"

              "Below is a broad, creative overview of how one might estimate the entire spectrum of R\u00e9nyi (generalized) dimensions \\(D_q\\) given:\n\n1. **A (possibly huge) set of samples** drawn from a measure \\(\\mu\\) in a very high dimensional space (the \u201cphase space\u201d).\n2. **An array of \\(-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) values**, where \\(p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) is the (estimated or computed) probability density at each sample \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\).\n\nThe goal: **Estimate** \n\\[\nD_q \\;=\\;\\frac{1}{q-1} \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0}\\,\\frac{\\ln \\bigl[Z_q(\\epsilon)\\bigr]}{\\ln(\\epsilon)},\n\\]\nwhere \n\\[\nZ_q(\\epsilon)\\;=\\;\\sum_{\\text{boxes of size }\\epsilon}\\bigl[\\mu(\\text{box})\\bigr]^q\n\\]\nor an equivalent definition in terms of local neighborhoods, correlation sums, or other multifractal methods.\n\nBelow are **five** possible strategies. Some are more \u201cstandard,\u201d others more \u201ccreative.\u201d All revolve around using your sample-based information about the density or the distribution\u2019s geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Direct \u201cPartition Function\u201d or \u201cBox-Counting\u201d Approach\n\n### 1.1 If you had the **full density** \\(p(\\mathbf{x})\\)\n\n- You could literally define a mesh (or tree-based partition) of box size \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n- For each box \\(B_j\\), compute \n  \\[\n  \\mu(B_j) \\;=\\; \\int_{B_j} p(\\mathbf{x})\\,d\\mathbf{x}.\n  \\]\n- Then compute \n  \\[\n  Z_q(\\epsilon)\\;=\\;\\sum_j [\\mu(B_j)]^q\n  \\]\n  and see how \\(Z_q(\\epsilon)\\) scales with \\(\\epsilon\\) as \\(\\epsilon \\to 0\\).  \n- Finally, compute \n  \\[\n  D_q \\;=\\;\\frac{1}{q-1}\\,\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0}\\frac{\\ln\\bigl(Z_q(\\epsilon)\\bigr)}{\\ln(\\epsilon)}.\n  \\]\n\nThis is the *theoretical* approach but is hopelessly expensive in high dimensions unless the attractor is extremely low-dimensional and you can do some *adaptive* partition focusing on the support of the measure.\n\n### 1.2 With **sampled data**:\n\n- You approximate \\(\\mu(B_j)\\) by the fraction of total probability mass in each box:\n  \\[\n  \\mu(B_j) \\;\\approx\\;\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{1}\\{\\mathbf{x}_i \\in B_j\\},\n  \\]\n  provided your samples are *already* drawn *with frequency proportional to \\(p(\\mathbf{x})\\)*.  \n- Then do the same \\(Z_q(\\epsilon)\\) calculation, only summing over boxes that actually contain points.  \n- Finer partitions require more data. In very high dimension, naive box counting is still tough. But you can adapt the partition (like an oct-tree, kd-tree, or top-down splitting) based on local densities to keep the box count manageable.\n\n**Pro**: Conceptually straightforward.  \n**Con**: Potentially large data requirements in high dimension.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Generalized Correlation Sums (Grassberger\u2013Procaccia for all \\(q\\))\n\nThe usual *correlation dimension* approach (Grassberger\u2013Procaccia) focuses on \\(D_2\\) by measuring\n\\[\nC(r) \\;=\\;\\frac{1}{N(N-1)}\\sum_{i\\neq j}\\Theta\\bigl(r - \\|\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j\\|\\bigr).\n\\]\nThen \\(C(r)\\sim r^{D_2}\\). But you can extend this to a *generalized correlation sum* for different exponents \\(q\\). Essentially you weight neighborhoods around each point by \\(\\mu(\\text{ball})^{q-1}\\).  \n\n- **Algorithmically**: For each sample \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\),\n  1. Find the number (or fraction) of points in the ball of radius \\(r\\) around \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\). This approximates \\(\\mu(B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r))\\).\n  2. Compute \\(\\bigl[\\mu(B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r))\\bigr]^{q-1}\\) and sum over \\(i\\).  \n- Vary \\(r\\) and fit a power law in \\(r\\).\n\nIn many references, you\u2019ll see something like\n\\[\nZ_q(r)\\;=\\;\\sum_{i=1}^N \\bigl[\\mu(B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r))\\bigr]^{q-1}.\n\\]\nThen\n\\[\nD_q \\;=\\;\\frac{1}{q-1}\\,\\lim_{r\\to 0}\\,\\frac{\\ln Z_q(r)}{\\ln(r)}.\n\\]\n\n**Pro**: Well-known in the chaos/fractals community.  \n**Con**: Potentially \\(\\mathcal{O}(N^2)\\) in naive form. But with efficient data structures (like ball trees, kd-trees, vantage-point trees), you can speed up neighbor queries.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Local Dimension / Pointwise Methods (Chhabra\u2013Jensen, etc.)\n\n**Multifractal** analysis often uses a local dimension approach:\n\n- For each point \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\), you want to estimate the local measure in a small ball of radius \\(r\\). Typically:\n  \\[\n  \\mu(B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r)) \\;\\approx\\;\\frac{k}{N}\n  \\]\n  if there are \\(k\\) samples within radius \\(r\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\).  \n- Then the local dimension at \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) is\n  \\[\n  d_{\\mathrm{loc}}(\\mathbf{x}_i) \\;=\\;\\lim_{r\\to 0}\\;\\frac{\\ln \\mu[B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r)]}{\\ln(r)}.\n  \\]\n  (technically we track how \\(\\ln(\\mu[B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r)])\\) scales with \\(\\ln(r)\\) as \\(r\\to 0\\)).  \n- To get the full *spectrum* of generalized dimensions \\(D_q\\), one can do a \u201cChhabra\u2013Jensen\u201d method, which is effectively weighting local contributions by \\(\\mu(B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r))^{q-1}\\). The details can be found in standard multifractal literature, but the gist is:\n  \\[\n  \\alpha(q) \\;=\\;\\lim_{r\\to 0}\\sum_i \\mu_i(q)\\,\\frac{\\ln \\mu(B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r))}{\\ln r},  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  f(\\alpha) \\;=\\;\\lim_{r\\to 0}\\sum_i \\mu_i(q)\\,\\frac{\\ln \\mu_i(q)}{\\ln r},\n  \\]\n  where\n  \\[\n  \\mu_i(q)\\;=\\;\\frac{[\\mu(B(\\mathbf{x}_i,r))]^q}{\\sum_j[\\mu(B(\\mathbf{x}_j,r))]^q}.\n  \\]\n  Then \\((\\alpha,f(\\alpha))\\) is the standard *multifractal spectrum*, and the generalized dimensions are\n  \\[\n  D_q \\;=\\;\\frac{\\alpha(q)}{q-1}.\n  \\]\n\n**Pro**: Very standard in physics for multifractal data (e.g., turbulence, strange attractors).  \n**Con**: Again can be expensive if \\(N\\) is large, but often more efficient than naive box-counting in large dimension.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Using \\(-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) Directly (a More \u201cCreative\u201d Idea)\n\nYou say you have a \u201chuge array of \\(-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\).\u201d Then \\(p(\\mathbf{x}_i) = e^{-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)}\\). If these points \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) are drawn **from** \\(p\\), we know that in principle \u201c\\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) appears with frequency proportional to \\(p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\).\u201d However, for fractal dimension, you need the measure\u2019s *geometric* concentration properties.\n\nA *potentially creative* approach:\n\n1. **Sort or bin your samples** by their \\(-\\log p\\) values. For instance, if the attractor is fractal, large \u201cdensity\u201d peaks indicate relatively stable subregions, while extremely small \u201cdensity\u201d indicates rarely visited (or dynamically repelling) areas.  \n2. For each range of \\(-\\log p\\), pick the subset of samples \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}\\) that have densities in that range. Then try to see how *clusters* or *balls around those points* are distributed.  \n3. If you can glean how \\(\\log p(\\mathbf{x})\\) correlates with typical distances between points in that range, you might deduce a local scaling exponent.  \n4. In principle, you might even do something like: \n   \\[\n   \\sum_i [p(\\mathbf{x}_i)]^q \\;\\approx\\;\\text{discrete sum of }\\exp\\bigl(-q\\,\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\bigr)\\;=\\;\\sum_i \\exp\\bigl(-(q)\\,(-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i))\\bigr).\n   \\]\n   Then try to see how that sum scales with the \u201cresolution\u201d in the data.  \n   This is tricky in high dimensions because you still need a sense of scale \\(\\epsilon\\) in real space. But \\(-\\log p\\) might help you rank the points from highest-likelihood to lowest-likelihood to guess where the measure is \u201cthin\u201d vs. \u201cthick.\u201d\n\n**Caveat**: This approach alone might not give you the dimension unless you tie it back to *spatial* (phase-space) distances. You need to connect \u201c\\(-\\log p\\) magnitude\u201d with \u201chow p is distributed across neighborhoods of radius \\(\\epsilon\\).\u201d It may still require a nearest-neighbor or radius-based method. But you can combine the knowledge of \\(-\\log p\\) with local geometry to expedite the process (e.g., focusing more attention on certain density \u201clevels\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Neural or Normalizing-Flow Approximation of \\(p(\\mathbf{x})\\)\n\nA more \u201cdata-science\u201d approach:\n\n1. **Train a normalizing flow** (or other generative model) \\(g_\\theta(\\cdot)\\) to approximate your measure \\(\\mu\\). If done well, you can sample from it cheaply and also evaluate \\(\\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})\\) quickly.  \n2. Once you have a parametric model, you can do more systematic (and possibly GPU-accelerated) methods to:\n   - Generate *many* synthetic points from the learned distribution, \n   - Evaluate local neighborhoods in the learned latent space, \n   - Or even do an *explicit* partition in the latent space (which might be of much lower dimension if the attractor is indeed low-dimensional).  \n3. Then you replicate whichever multifractal method you prefer (box-counting in latent space, correlation sums, etc.) but hopefully in a more *efficient geometry*.\n\n**Pro**: Might drastically reduce cost if the attractor indeed has dimension < 6 while the raw grid dimension is large.  \n**Con**: Requires training a normalizing flow or some manifold-learning method that faithfully captures the fractal geometry (which can be tricky if the attractor is truly fractal, because fractals are not always easy for standard smooth flows to approximate).\n\n---\n\n## Handling Large Negative \\(-\\log p\\) or Large Dimensional Entropy\n\nRegardless of the method, you\u2019ll likely see huge negative \\(\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) values in high dimension. **That\u2019s normal** and doesn\u2019t by itself hinder dimension estimation. *Dimension depends on how measure (density) scales with neighborhood size*, not on the absolute magnitude of \\(\\log p\\).\n\n- You can always \u201cshift\u201d all \\(\\log p\\) values by a constant \\(C\\) to keep them in a manageable numeric range. For dimension or relative scaling, that shift cancels out. \n- For truly computing integrals like Shannon entropy, a shift is not benign (you\u2019d have to re-normalize). But for fractal dimension, an additive shift in \\(\\log p\\) does **not** matter.\n\n---\n\n## Putting It All Together (A Practical Recipe)\n\n1. **Check the straightforward correlation-sum approach** (Grassberger\u2013Procaccia generalized to \\(q\\neq 2\\)). If you can handle \\(\\mathcal{O}(N^2)\\) or can accelerate with trees, do it on a moderate sample to get a sense of \\(D_q\\).  \n2. **Try local dimension** (Chhabra\u2013Jensen) on small neighborhoods: pick each sample, find its \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors, estimate local measure, vary \\(k\\), and see how \\(\\mu(B(\\mathbf{x},r))\\sim r^{d_{\\mathrm{loc}}(\\mathbf{x})}\\). Combine for a multifractal spectrum if you want \\(D_q\\) for multiple \\(q\\).  \n3. **If you have explicit \\(-\\log p\\) for each point** (and can evaluate it for new points, or at least for neighbors), you can integrate that knowledge. For instance, you can rank points by density, adapt your local search radius to find similarly dense points, and see how the measure lumps them in phase space.  \n4. **In high dimension**: strongly consider manifold or flow-based approximations if direct methods are too large. If the attractor is truly ~6D, try dimension-reduction or manifold-learning (e.g., local PCA, Isomap, diffusion maps) on your sample to find a 6D manifold embedded in a huge space, then do a standard 6D fractal analysis.\n\n**Answer to \u201cCan I scale \\(-\\log p\\)?\u201d**  \n- You can always add a constant shift to \\(\\log p\\). That won\u2019t change dimension (since dimension is about how \\(\\log p\\) changes locally, not its absolute offset).  \n- Multiplying \\(\\log p\\) by a constant would change the measure if you tried to interpret it as the \u201ctrue\u201d probability density. For dimension estimates, you don\u2019t want to break the correct measure. So do not multiply\u2014just shift if you need to prevent under/overflow.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n**Yes**, you can measure \\(D_q\\) from a finite (but large) set of samples of \\(\\mu\\). Classic methods:\n\n- **Generalized correlation integrals** (extending Grassberger\u2013Procaccia).  \n- **Local dimension** / multifractal box-counting (Chhabra\u2013Jensen).  \n\nEither approach uses how \u201cmass lumps in small neighborhoods\u201d as a function of the radius. You do **not** need the absolute scale of \\(\\log p\\); the *relative* geometry is what matters. If you leverage your \\(\\log p\\) data to guide an adaptive or hierarchical approach, you might cut down on computations significantly. Or, if the attractor is indeed near ~6D, a manifold-learning approach might be the most \u201ccreative\u201d modern path to get the full \\(D_q\\) spectrum without an astronomical number of pointwise distance checks."

              "Below are some more \u201cout\u2010of\u2010the\u2010box\u201d ideas for extracting the fractal (or multifractal) dimension from large\u2010scale \\(-\\log p\\) data **without** doing a full\u2010blown box\u2010counting or \\(N^2\\) neighbor search.  The short version is that simply having a histogram of \\(-\\log p\\) values, *by itself*, is **not** enough to pin down fractal dimension\u2014dimension is about *geometry* (how measure changes when you zoom in on neighborhoods), whereas a single histogram only shows the *marginal distribution* of density values.  \n\nThat said, here are some creative ways forward:\n\n---\n\n## 1) Use the Flow\u2019s Local Expansion/Contraction (Lyapunov\u2010Type Approach)\n\nBecause you have an autonomous flow \n\\[\n\\partial_t A(x,t)=f[A](x),\n\\]\nyou also know it has a large negative divergence (infinite\u2010dimensional analog of \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}<0\\)).  \n\n- **If** you can evaluate (or approximate) the **linearization** of \\(f\\) around trajectories\u2014i.e. the functional derivative \\(\\delta f/\\delta A\\)\u2014you can attempt to estimate *Lyapunov exponents* (or their infinite\u2010dimensional analog).  \n- In finite\u2010dimensional chaotic systems, the *Kaplan\u2013Yorke formula* relates the **sum of positive Lyapunov exponents** to the attractor\u2019s dimension.  Roughly, if \\(\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\ldots\\) are the ordered Lyapunov exponents (some might be negative), then  \n  \\[\n  D_{\\mathrm{KY}} \\;=\\; k \\;+\\;\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k\\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{k+1}|},\n  \\]\n  where \\(k\\) is the largest integer such that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i \\ge 0\\).  \n- **Pro**: You do *not* need a high\u2010dimensional neighbor search.  Instead, you track the tangent\u2010space flow along one (or a few) trajectories, accumulate average exponential rates, and apply the usual chaotic\u2010dynamics machinery.  \n- **Con**: In PDE contexts, computing these exponents can still be expensive (one must integrate the linearized PDE around the trajectory).  But it often scales better than, say, an \\(\\mathcal{O}(N^2)\\) correlation dimension method.\n\nIn many chaotic PDEs (e.g. Kuramoto\u2013Sivashinsky, Navier\u2013Stokes in certain regimes, etc.), the Kaplan\u2013Yorke (or Lyapunov) dimension is *the* standard tool to characterize a low\u2010dimensional attractor in a nominally huge function space.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Random Low\u2010Dimensional Projections (\u201cSlicing\u201d or \u201cSketching\u201d)\n\nEven if you cannot do a full correlation integral in the full high\u2010dimensional space, you can:\n\n1. **Project** your data \\(\\{A_i\\}\\) down to a *random* 1D or 2D subspace (like taking random linear combinations of the grid points).\n2. In that lower\u2010dimensional projection, it becomes much cheaper to do a \u201ccorrelation integral\u201d or \u201cbox count.\u201d  \n   - If the attractor truly has dimension \\(D\\) much smaller than the ambient dimension, *most* random 1D or 2D projections should still reveal some signature of that fractal geometry (albeit with possible distortions).  \n   - Typically, if a set is fractal of dimension \\(D\\ll\\text{(ambient dimension)}\\), then almost all random linear projections produce a set whose dimension is \\(\\min(D,\\text{dimension of the projection})\\).  \n\nYou could do, say, a dozen random 2D projections, measure an \u201ceffective dimension\u201d in each 2D plane (via standard 2D correlation sums or box\u2010counting, which is now feasible), and see if it saturates near some stable value \\(\\le 2\\).  That stable value can be the fractal dimension if \\(D<2\\).  Likewise in 1D, you might see a slope in a log\u2013log correlation plot that saturates at \\(\\min(D,1)\\).\n\n**Pro**: This is *much* cheaper than a full 100k\u2010dimensional correlation dimension.  \n**Con**: If your attractor\u2019s dimension is bigger than 2, you only get partial coverage in a 2D projection (it \u201ccollapses\u201d the geometry).  You might glean a lower bound or partial dimension estimate.  Sometimes repeating with multiple random subspaces of dimension 3,4,\u2026 can bracket the actual dimension.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Exploit the PDE\u2019s Probability\u2010Transport Equation Directly\n\nYou mentioned you actually evolve a *probability density* \\(p[A,t]\\) via \n\\[\n\\partial_t p \\;=\\; -\\,\\text{div}_A\\bigl[f\\,p\\bigr] \\;=\\; \\dots\n\\]\nin functional form.  Then \n\\[\n\\partial_t \\bigl(-\\log p[A,t]\\bigr)\\;=\\; \\dots\n\\]\n(involving \\(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A}\\)).  \n\nIf you keep track of \n\\[\nH(t)\\;=\\;-\\int p(A,t)\\,\\log p(A,t)\\,dA\n\\]\n(Shannon entropy), it might blow up numerically because \\(\\log p\\) is on the order of \\(-10^6\\).  But you can sometimes look at the *derivative* of \\(H(t)\\) in time:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dH}{dt} \\;=\\;\\dots\n\\]\nwhich depends on \\(\\int \\text{div}_A(f\\,p)\\log p\\,dA\\).  In some flows (especially with constant diffusion or viscosity), there are known relationships between the *rate* of entropy production and the \u201ceffective dimension\u201d of the attractor.  This is system\u2010dependent but can be easier than directly measuring \\(H\\) itself.\n\nIn short: if your PDE or functional flow has a known formula linking \\(\\frac{d}{dt}H(t)\\) to the sum of certain eigenvalues, you might invert that to get an estimate of dimension.  This is somewhat analogous to the Lyapunov approach but framed in the PDE\u2019s Fokker\u2013Planck or Liouville equation.\n\n---\n\n## 4) \u201cLocal\u201d Dimension Estimates with a *Small* Subsample\n\nEven though you say *full* correlation or box dimension is too big, you might not need *all* your points.  Sometimes a carefully chosen **random subsample** of modest size (e.g., a few thousand points) is enough to get a decent measure of dimension, especially if you only want an integer or half\u2010integer accuracy.  \n\n1. Pick (say) 5k\u201320k random points from your big dataset.  \n2. Build a *k\u2010d tree* or *vantage\u2010point tree* for those points.  \n3. For each point, get the distance to its \\(k\\)th nearest neighbor, for a range of \\(k\\).  \n4. Estimate the local dimension from how \\(k\\) scales with radius.  Sum or average over the set.  \n\n**Pro**: 20k points in a well\u2010structured tree is not always *that* bad computationally, especially with approximate nearest neighbors.  \n**Con**: Still an \\(\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)\\) or so method, which can be big if \\(N\\) is truly enormous.  But it might be *much* smaller than your total dataset size.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Relating \\(\\{-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\}\\) to Dimension \u2026 Carefully\n\nA single histogram of \\(-\\log p\\) does *not* reveal dimension.  However, if you can evaluate \\(\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) *and* you can do at least a **small** local\u2010geometry check (like a radius search or nearest\u2010neighbor distance) around each \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\), then you can try a \u201cdensity\u2013distance\u201d relationship:\n\n- **Idea**:  In a \\(d\\)-dimensional (locally) uniform cluster, if the local density is \\(p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\), then the mass in a ball of radius \\(r\\) near \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) is \\(\\approx p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\,\\pi^{d/2} r^d / \\Gamma(\\frac{d}{2}+1)\\), ignoring fractal complexities for the moment.  \n- If you can measure the actual fraction of points within radius \\(r\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) and compare it to \\(p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\cdot r^d\\), you glean a local dimension.  \n- Do that for a random subset of points, then average or do a distribution.  \n\nThat\u2019s effectively a local dimension approach that uses \\(\\log p\\) plus partial geometry.  Crucially, you still need some measure of \u201cdistance\u201d in phase space.  But you do *not* have to do a big global correlation integral\u2014just local neighborhoods for a small fraction of points.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Shrinking\u2010Radius or Random\u2010Direction Probes\n\nOne more trick (if even local neighbor queries are expensive):\n\n- **Pick a random point** \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\).  \n- **Generate random directions** \\(\\hat{u}\\) in your high\u2010dimensional space, and do a \u201cline search\u201d outward from \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) by small increments \\(\\rho\\,\\hat{u}\\).  (You might do a bounding \u201cbinary search\u201d until you are \u201ctoo far\u201d from the attractor or no longer find points in your dataset.)\n- Keep track of which other data points \\(\\mathbf{x}_j\\) lie near that line.  \n- Estimate how quickly the measure \u201cfills out\u201d the radial shell, using the local density \\(p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) or \\(\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) as a reference.  \n\nThis is obviously a bit hacky, but it can drastically reduce the dimension of the search (just 1D stepping outward from each point).  If your attractor is truly low\u2010dimensional, you\u2019ll see characteristic ways that points cluster around \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) in random directions.  Summing up many random directions (and a modest random subset of base points) might approximate dimension.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n1. **Just a histogram of \\(-\\log p\\)** on the attractor cannot directly yield fractal dimension\u2014dimension depends on *spatial scaling* of the measure, not just how often various densities occur.\n2. **However**, you *can* combine knowledge of \\(\\log p\\) with *some* minimal geometric information (like local neighbor distances, random lines, or local expansions from the PDE) to extract dimension *far* more cheaply than a naive global box\u2010count.\n3. A particularly robust approach is to compute **Lyapunov exponents** from the flow\u2019s linearization if your PDE is amenable.  That is often the go\u2010to method in high\u2010dimensional chaotic systems precisely because standard correlation\u2010dimension methods become infeasible.\n\nIn short: to get \\(D_q\\) (or even just \\(D_1\\)), you need *some* notion of how \u201cnearby\u201d states scale in measure as you shrink neighborhoods\u2014no way around it.  But you do *not* have to do a big \\(N^2\\) distance matrix or high\u2010dimensional box partition.  Either do a small local dimension method with a tree or approximate neighbors, or do a PDE approach (Lyapunov exponents, probability\u2010transport equation), or attempt some random\u2010projection or random\u2010line scheme to reduce the geometry overhead."

              "Below are a few \u201cout\u2010of\u2010the\u2010box\u201d ways to get at **fractal dimension** (or the \\(D_q\\) spectrum) **without** doing the usual (and often prohibitively expensive) neighbor\u2010counting, box\u2010counting, or correlation\u2010dimension calculations directly in the high\u2010dimensional field. You already have a histogram of \\(-\\log p\\) on the attractor, and you know these values become huge (e.g.\\ \\(-10^6\\)). The question is: **Can we extract dimension just from \\(\\{-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\}\\) and knowledge of the flow?** \n\nBelow are four main ideas. None is a \u201csilver bullet\u201d that uses only a single static histogram of \\(-\\log p\\).  However, if you can combine your \\(-\\log p\\) data with a **small amount** of extra information\u2014like how \\(-\\log p\\) changes under a coarsening of the grid, or how it evolves in time, or how the local Jacobian (divergence) behaves\u2014then you *can* back out an estimate of fractal dimension (and even multifractal exponents).  \n\n---\n\n## 1. **Multi\u2010Resolution** (Coarse\u2010to\u2010Fine) **Scaling Approach**\n\nIf you can run or store the flow at **different grid resolutions** (for example  \\(64^2,\\;128^2,\\;256^2\\), etc.)\u2014or otherwise \u201ccoarsen\u201d your state \\(A(x)\\)\u2014you can track how the **typical** value of \\(-\\log p(\\mathbf{x})\\) **scales** with the **number of degrees of freedom**.  \n\n- **Why this helps**:  \n  If your measure is effectively supported on a \\(D\\)\u2010dimensional attractor (with \\(D \\ll\\) the nominal dimension), then as you refine the grid from \u201ccoarse\u201d to \u201cfine,\u201d the *effective volume* explored by the system often scales like \\(\\epsilon^D\\), not \\(\\epsilon^d\\) (where \\(d\\) is the full discretized dimension).  \n  Consequently, the typical \\(-\\log p\\) grows more *slowly* than it would for a full \\(d\\)-dimensional volume\u2010filling state.  \n- **Procedure sketch**:\n  1. Solve/evolve your PDE on a coarse grid. Compute a histogram of \\(-\\log p\\). Extract some measure of central tendency\u2014e.g.\\ \\(\\mathbb{E}[-\\log p]\\) (the \u201ctypical surprise\u201d).  \n  2. Refine the grid, rerun or refine the solution, do the same measurement.  \n  3. Plot \\(\\mathbb{E}[-\\log p]\\) versus \\(\\ln(N)\\) where \\(N\\) is the number of grid points (or degrees of freedom).  \n  4. If the data fall near a straight line with slope < 1, that slope can be interpreted in terms of an *effective dimension* \\(D\\). (There is some care needed with constants, but in principle one sees a linear relationship \\(\\mathbb{E}[-\\log p]\\approx D \\ln(\\text{grid scale}^{-1})\\) when the measure \u201clives\u201d in \\(D\\) dimensions.)\n\nThis \u201c**coarse\u2010to\u2010fine**\u201d trick is conceptually related to box\u2010counting but done in the **configuration space** (the PDE grid) rather than the **phase space**.  If your PDE solution is truly locking onto a fractal attractor, the total \u201cspread\u201d in phase space stops increasing in a \\(d\\)-dimensional sense and instead follows a dimension \\(D\\).  You effectively watch how \\(\\log p\\) changes as your \u201cresolution scale\u201d \\(\\epsilon\\) changes.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. **Time\u2010Evolution of \\(-\\log p\\)** and Average Divergence\n\nIf your PDE obeys  \n\\[\n\\partial_t A(x,t) \\;=\\; f[A](x),\n\\]  \nand your ensemble density \\(p[A,t]\\) evolves under that flow, then the *time derivative* of \\(\\log p\\) is tied to the **divergence** of \\(f\\).  In finite\u2010dimensional chaotic systems,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\log p(\\mathbf{z},t)\n\\;=\\;\n-\\,\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{z},t).\n\\]\n\nIn an infinite\u2010dimensional field setting, the analogous statement is\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t \\log p[A,t]\n\\;=\\;\n-\\,\\int \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A(x)} \\,dx.\n\\]\n\n- If you **track \\(-\\log p\\) along trajectories** over time, you can in principle relate its time derivative to the **(functional) divergence**.  \n- For a chaotic/fractal attractor, the negative divergence is large in certain directions.  The *Kaplan\u2013Yorke* or *Lyapunov dimension* of the attractor can often be deduced from knowledge of the partial sums of (positive + negative) Lyapunov exponents or from integrals of the divergence along typical trajectories.  \n\nIn short: if you can **measure or estimate** the flow\u2019s divergence (or the sum of its largest expanding/contracting directions) along the attractor, you can back out a fractal dimension.  This is essentially the \u201cLyapunov dimension\u201d approach in PDE language.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. **Use \\(-\\log p\\) *Ratios* to Probe Local Concentration**\n\nEven if you do *not* want to do a full correlation sum or box\u2010counting, you might still do a **lightweight nearest\u2010neighbor** check on *just a small random subset* of points:\n\n1. Pick a modest subset \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}_{i=1}^M\\) from your big sample (where \\(M\\) is, say, a few thousand\u2014small enough to do distance queries).  \n2. For each \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\), find the distance to its \\(k\\)-th nearest neighbor. Call that distance \\(r_i\\).  \n3. If you also know \\(-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\), you can try to see how that local *density estimate* from neighbors compares with the *\\(-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\)* from your PDE or flow code.  \n   - In a self\u2010consistent fractal measure, \\(\\mu(\\mathbf{ball}(\\mathbf{x}_i,r_i)) \\approx p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\times (\\text{volume of ball})\\) if \\(p\\) is roughly constant inside that ball.  \n   - Then the dimension emerges from how that volume scales like \\(r_i^D\\).  \n\nEven a small neighbor\u2010search can reveal whether \\(\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) is consistent with an effective local dimension \\(D\\).  This is a partial or \u201csparse\u201d version of correlation dimension that **focuses only on verifying the geometry implied by your \\(-\\log p\\) field**.  You do not need to do an all\u2010pairs comparison on millions of points, just enough neighbors for a manageable subset.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. **Integral Moments of \\(p^q\\)** (Chhabra\u2013Jensen\u2010Type Argument)\n\nThe standard formula for generalized (R\u00e9nyi) dimensions is\n\\[\nD_q \n\\;=\\;\n\\frac{1}{q-1}\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\frac{\\ln\\Bigl[\\sum_j \\mu(B_j)^q\\Bigr]}{\\ln(\\epsilon)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu(B_j)\\) is the measure in \u201cbox\u201d \\(B_j\\) of size \\(\\epsilon\\).  Normally one does a box\u2010count or correlation approach.  **But** if you have a \u201ccontinuous\u201d estimate \\(p(\\mathbf{x})\\), you can do something akin to  \n\\[\nZ_q(\\epsilon) \n\\;\\equiv\\; \n\\int [p(\\mathbf{x})]^q \\,d\\mathbf{x}\n\\;\\approx\\;\n\\sum_{i=1}^N [p(\\mathbf{x}_i)]^q \\cdot w_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(w_i\\) are small volumetric weights (depending on how your sample was drawn).  \n\n- You *still* need a notion of scale \\(\\epsilon\\).  That might come from:\n  - A coarse grid vs.\\ fine grid (back to item #1).\n  - A small\u2010neighbor kernel estimate of \\(\\int p^q\\).  \n- Once you can systematically vary \\(\\epsilon\\) (the \u201cresolution\u201d of your measure in phase space), you fit a slope in \\(\\ln Z_q(\\epsilon)\\) vs. \\(\\ln\\epsilon\\).  That slope gives \\(D_q\\).  \n\n**Key point**: this approach does not require building a big mesh in the full high\u2010dimensional space if you can systematically \u201ccoarse\u2010grain\u201d your measure or use an adaptive kernel.  You do, however, need more than *just* one histogram of \\(-\\log p\\); you need to see how \\(-\\log p\\) aggregates or \u201ccoarse\u2010grains\u201d at different scales.\n\n---\n\n## Putting It All Together\n\n1. **Simply looking at the histogram** of \\(\\{-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\)\\ **at one fixed resolution** (the final PDE grid) does *not* by itself give fractal dimension.  Fractal dimension is about how measure scales *when you zoom in*, i.e.\\ how \\(\\log p\\) changes with changes in \u201cresolution\u201d or local radius.  \n2. **However**, you can exploit:\n   - A **multi\u2010resolution** approach (running or post\u2010processing coarser versions of your system),  \n   - A **lightweight** local\u2010neighborhood approach (on a **small** subset of samples), or  \n   - The **flow divergence** (Lyapunov exponent) approach if you can measure it.  \n3. **Shifting** your giant \\(-\\log p\\) values by a constant (e.g.\\ add \\(10^6\\)) to keep them numerically tame is fine for dimension *since only relative scaling matters*.  You just cannot interpret \u201c\\(-\\log p\\) + \\text{constant}\u201d as the absolute negative log\u2010density if you do that.  \n4. If you truly want the **full \\(D_q\\) spectrum** (multifractal spectrum), you still need how \\([p(\\mathbf{x})]^q\\) aggregates at different scales.  That inevitably involves some \u201ccoarse\u2010graining,\u201d but you do *not* have to do a full box\u2010count or correlation sum at huge \\(N\\).  You can do an **adaptive** method or even a partial method that uses the PDE flow structure or a small sample of neighbor distances.\n\nIn short, **dimension** demands knowledge about how the measure \u201cpacks\u201d itself in state space at smaller and smaller neighborhoods.  A single histogram of \\(\\{-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\}\\) at one discretization can\u2019t fully reveal that.  But by being clever with (a) multiple resolutions, (b) partial neighbor/geometry checks, or (c) PDE divergence/flow analysis, you *can* back out the fractal dimension *without* an enormous correlation\u2010dimension calculation."

              "Here is a concise way to see where the formula\n\n\\[\nH_q(\\epsilon) \\;=\\; h_q \\;+\\; D_q \\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr)\n\\]\n\ncomes from, how it is used, and **what** one typically chooses for \\(\\epsilon\\) in a discretized PDE or \u201ccoarse\u2010grained\u201d setting.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Entropy Growth Under Finer Discretization\n\nIn **finite** \\(d\\)-dimensional Euclidean space, one often sees that when you replace the continuous distribution by a grid of mesh size \\(\\epsilon\\), the **discrete** entropy (in bits or nats) grows like\n\n\\[\nH(\\epsilon) \\;=\\; \\bigl(\\text{differential entropy}\\bigr) \\;+\\; d\\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr)\n\\]\n \nfor small \\(\\epsilon\\). That extra term \\(d\\,\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) reflects the fact that as \\(\\epsilon\\to 0\\), you get more and more discrete bins (on the order of \\(\\epsilon^{-d}\\)), so the discrete entropy \u201cblows up\u201d with \\(\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr)\\). Meanwhile, the **differential entropy** \\(h\\) stays finite (or at least does not blow up simply because of changing \\(\\epsilon\\)).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Generalizing to a Fractal/Multifractal Measure\n\nWhen the *effective support* of your measure is a fractal of dimension \\(D\\ll d\\), then as \\(\\epsilon\\) shrinks, the measure really only \u201coccupies\u201d about \\(\\epsilon^{-D}\\) bins, not \\(\\epsilon^{-d}\\). Hence, you often see\n\n\\[\nH(\\epsilon) \\;\\approx\\; \\underbrace{h}_{\\text{finite term}}\n\\;+\\;\nD\\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr).\n\\]\n\n### 2.1 The \\(q\\)-generalized version\n\nFor the R\u00e9nyi (or Tsallis, etc.) entropies \\(H_q\\), the same scaling idea holds but now the exponent is the *generalized* fractal dimension \\(D_q\\). Formally,\n\n\\[\nH_q(\\epsilon) \n\\;=\\; \nh_q \n\\;+\\; \nD_q\\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr)\n\\quad\n\\text{for small }\\epsilon.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) is the *coarse\u2010grained* R\u00e9nyi entropy of order \\(q\\), computed on a grid whose cell size is \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n- \\(h_q\\) is a finite piece (sometimes called the \u201cdifferential \\(q\\)\u2010entropy\u201d or something analogous) that does *not* diverge with \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n- \\(D_q\\) is the fractal (or multifractal) dimension associated with that order \\(q\\).  \n\n---\n\n## 3. **What Exactly Is \\(\\epsilon\\)?**\n\nIn a PDE on a 2D domain (say \\([0,1]\\times[0,1]\\)), if you discretize with an \\(H\\times W\\) grid, then:\n\n- The **physical** grid spacing (in the spatial domain) is \\(\\Delta x \\approx 1/H\\), \\(\\Delta y \\approx 1/W\\).  \n- But the **full** phase space dimension is actually \\(\\text{dim} = H \\times W\\) if each grid cell\u2019s amplitude is a separate degree of freedom.  \n- Hence, to talk about \\(\\epsilon\\) in *phase space*, you\u2019re referring to the \u201cresolution\u201d with which you record or bin the entire *vector* of \\((H\\times W)\\) field values.  \n\nIn other words, if you store your PDE state as a single vector \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{H\\cdot W}\\), then a \u201cgrid spacing\u201d in **phase space** might say:  \n> *Each amplitude is quantized at step size \\(\\delta\\).*  \n\n- So the *linear* scale in your **phase space** is \\(\\delta\\).  \n- This means each real amplitude is binned into intervals of width \\(\\delta\\).  \n- The total number of bins in that high\u2010dimensional vector is on the order of \\(\\delta^{-\\,H\\times W}\\).  \n\nBut if the attractor is effectively fractal of dimension \\(D_q\\), then the discrete entropy grows like\n\n\\[\nH_q(\\delta) \\;\\sim\\; D_q\\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\delta}\\bigr) \n\\;+\\; \\text{constant}\n\\]\n\ninstead of \\((H\\cdot W)\\,\\ln(\\tfrac{1}{\\delta})\\).\n\n### 3.1 Common Practical Definition\n\nMany authors loosely identify  \n\\[\n\\epsilon \\;\\equiv\\; \\delta,\n\\]\nthe **quantization resolution** of your PDE state vector.  Equivalently, if you truly had a uniform binning in the PDE amplitude domain, you define  \n\\[\n\\epsilon = (\\text{bin width of each amplitude dimension}).\n\\]\n\nIf your PDE domain is itself being refined in *physical space* from coarse to fine (like going from \\(64^2\\) to \\(128^2\\) to \\(256^2\\)), you might pick\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon \\;=\\; \\text{some function of }1/(H\\times W)\n\\quad\\text{or more precisely }\\epsilon \\sim \\Delta x^{\\alpha_1}\\,\\Delta y^{\\alpha_2}\\text{ etc.}\n\\]\n\nBut **strictly** in the formula \\(H_q(\\epsilon) = h_q + D_q \\ln(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon})\\), \\(\\epsilon\\) is the relevant *coarse\u2010graining scale in phase space*, i.e.\\ \u201cHow finely do I quantize the entire PDE state?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4. Using the Formula in Practice\n\n1. **Compute \\(H_q\\) at multiple coarse\u2010grain levels**.  \n   - You can do this by changing how finely you bin your PDE state.  For example, store snapshots of your PDE with 8\u2010bit precision, 16\u2010bit precision, 32\u2010bit precision\u2026 and measure the discrete \\(q\\)\u2010entropy each time.  \n   - Or if you have a normalizing flow or some sampling method for your PDE measure, you can artificially quantize your samples to different step sizes \\(\\delta\\).  \n2. **Fit** \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) versus \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) to a straight line.  \n   - The slope is your **dimension** \\(D_q\\).  \n   - The intercept is \\(h_q\\).  \n\nOf course, you need a range of \\(\\epsilon\\) values that\u2019s small enough to see fractal scaling *but* large enough to have stable statistics (no underflow in probabilities, not too few bins, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summarizing Answers to Your Specific Questions\n\n1. **Is  \n\\(\\displaystyle\nH_q \\;=\\; h_q \\;+\\; D_q \\,\\ln \\bigl(1/\\epsilon\\bigr)\n\\)\nthe right formula?**  \n   - Yes, in the sense that *for a measure concentrated on a \\(D_q\\)*\u2010dimensional set*, the *coarse\u2010grained* (R\u00e9nyi) entropy \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) scales linearly in \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\). The constant term \\(h_q\\) is the \u201ccontinuous\u201d part that does *not* diverge.  \n\n2. **What do I set \\(\\epsilon\\) to?**  \n   - \\(\\epsilon\\) is the *coarse\u2010graining (bin) size in the full phase space*, i.e.\\ how finely you discretize the entire PDE state vector.  \n   - If you are changing your *spatial* grid resolution (e.g.\\ going from a \\(H\\times W\\) PDE mesh to a finer one), that changes the dimension of the PDE state vector.  You *also* might change the amplitude quantization for each grid point. In principle, you can treat *either* as adjusting \\(\\epsilon\\), so long as you keep track of how \u201cthe number of effectively distinct states\u201d changes.  \n\n3. **Should I think about discretizing the PDE domain to \\(H\\times W\\) points?**  \n   - That\u2019s part of it: the PDE domain discretization sets the dimension of your \u201craw\u201d state space. But the *coarse\u2010graining scale \\(\\epsilon\\)* is about how finely you differentiate states *within* that \\(H\\times W\\) space.  \n   - For instance, if each of the \\(H\\times W\\) amplitudes is binned into 256 steps (8 bits), that corresponds to a certain \\(\\epsilon\\). If you reduce that to 16 steps, you have a bigger \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n\n4. **Exact formula for \\(\\epsilon\\)**  \n   - There is no single \u201cuniversal\u201d formula; it depends on how you define your binning or quantization in your PDE state. In many references, one picks \\(\\epsilon = \\delta\\), the \u201clinear\u201d quantization step for each dimension of your PDE solution vector.  \n   - If your PDE domain is 2D or 3D, you might tie \\(\\epsilon\\) to the *spatial resolution* \\(\\Delta x\\), or to \\(\\Delta x\\) *and* \\(\\Delta y\\), etc.  Typically you do something like \u201c\\(\\epsilon \\sim (\\Delta x)^\\alpha\\)\u201d if each grid point has a continuous amplitude.  \n\n---\n\n### Concluding Remarks\n\n- **Yes**, your formula \\(H_q(\\epsilon) = h_q + D_q\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) is the standard relationship linking coarse\u2010grained entropy to fractal dimension.  \n- **\\(\\epsilon\\)** is the \u201ccoarse\u2010graining scale\u201d in the *phase space* (the PDE state space).  In practice, you often interpret it as the amplitude\u2010quantization step or an effective bin size across the entire state vector.  \n- To actually *measure* \\(D_q\\), you must vary \\(\\epsilon\\) systematically and check how \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) grows. The slope in that log\u2010plot is your fractal dimension \\(D_q\\).  \n\nThis approach is effectively a \u201ccoarse\u2010to\u2010fine\u201d analysis of the PDE\u2019s state distribution, letting you back out the fractal dimension that explains *why* the discrete entropy \u201cblows up\u201d more slowly than the naive dimension \\(H\\times W\\)."

              "First, let\u2019s restate the distinction:\n\n- **\\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\)** is the usual *coarse\u2010grained* \\(q\\)\u2010entropy (R\u00e9nyi or Tsallis type), which involves *summing* over discrete bins weighted by the probability \\(p_b\\), e.g.\\ \n  \\[\n  H_q(\\epsilon)\\;=\\;\\frac{1}{1-q}\\,\\ln\\Bigl(\\sum_b [p_b(\\epsilon)]^q\\Bigr).\n  \\]\n  In the Shannon case (\\(q=1\\)), it becomes \\(\\,-\\sum_b p_b\\ln p_b\\).  \n\n- **\\(I(\\epsilon)\\) or \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\)**, by contrast, is something like a *sum* (or *average*) of \\(-\\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) **without** an extra factor of \\(p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) in the summation/integral.  Concretely, if you have \\(N\\) samples from the measure:\n  \\[\n  I(\\epsilon)\\;=\\;\\sum_{i=1}^N \\bigl[-\\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\bigr].\n  \\]\n  Sometimes people call this the \u201cnegative log\u2010likelihood\u201d of the sample, or the \u201cempirical surprise.\u201d\n\nIn a **continuous** setting, the *expected value* of \\(-\\ln p(X)\\) (if \\(X\\sim p\\)) is essentially the **differential entropy** (plus any needed constants if you are changing resolution).  In *fractal* or *multifractal* settings, both \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) and \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\) typically show **logarithmic divergences** with the coarse\u2010graining scale \\(\\epsilon\\), but for slightly different reasons.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Standard Scaling for \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\)\n\nFor a measure supported on (or heavily concentrated in) a fractal of dimension \\(D_q\\), the *coarse\u2010grained* R\u00e9nyi entropy obeys (as \\(\\epsilon\\to 0\\)):\n\n\\[\nH_q(\\epsilon) \\;=\\; h_q \\;+\\; D_q \\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr),\n\\]\n\nwhere \n- \\(h_q\\) is a non\u2010divergent part (like a \u201cdifferential \\(q\\)\u2010entropy\u201d), \n- \\(D_q\\) is the **generalized fractal dimension** one is after,\n- \\(\\epsilon\\) is the bin\u2010size (or quantization step) in *phase space*.\n\nThis is well\u2010known: as you make the bins smaller, the *number* of \u201coccupied bins\u201d (weighted in the sense of \\(\\sum p_b^q\\)) grows like \\(\\epsilon^{-D_q}\\).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Does the *Sum of \\(-\\ln p\\)* Obey a Similar Relation?\n\n### 2.1 The short answer\n\n**Yes**, in many fractal or high\u2010dimensional contexts, the *sum* (or average) of \\(-\\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) also grows like\n\n\\[\nI(\\epsilon) \\;=\\; i(\\epsilon) + D_{\\text{eff}}\\;\\ln\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr),\n\\]\n\nfor some effective dimension \\(D_{\\text{eff}}\\).  If you define a *\\(q\\)\u2010variant* (for instance, summing \\(-\\ln [p(\\mathbf{x}_i)]^q\\), etc.), you will again pick out a fractal dimension \\(D_q\\).  \n\n### 2.2 Why it still reveals a fractal dimension\n\n1. If your samples \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}\\) are *drawn from* the measure \\(p\\), then *in expectation*, \n   \\[\n   \\mathbb{E}_{X\\sim p}[-\\ln p(X)]\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\int p(x)\\,[-\\ln p(x)]\\,dx\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\text{(differential entropy)}.\n   \\]\n   - As you refine your discretization (in phase space) from scale \\(\\epsilon\\) to \\(\\epsilon/2\\), the typical values of \\(\\,-\\ln p(\\mathbf{x})\\) \u201cshift\u201d in a way that depends on how the measure sits in the big space.  \n   - If the measure is effectively \\(D\\)\u2010dimensional, then we get a characteristic \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) divergence with coefficient \\(D\\).\n\n2. **Key point**:  \n   Even though \\(I(\\epsilon)\\) is *not* weighting each bin by \\(p\\) in the usual sense, *drawing the samples from \\(p\\)* means there is an implicit weighting.  The *frequency* with which \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) appears is *itself* \\(\\propto p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\).  \n   So in practice,\n   \\[\n   I(\\epsilon)\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\sum_{i=1}^N [-\\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i)]\n   \\;\\approx\\;\n   N\\;\\mathbb{E}_{X\\sim p}[-\\ln p(X)]\n   \\]\n   when \\(N\\) is large.  And that expectation can exhibit the same fractal\u2010scaling phenomenon with dimension \\(D\\).\n\nThus you\u2019ll see a similar formula:\n\n\\[\nI(\\epsilon) \\;=\\; i_1 \\;+\\; D_1 \\,\\ln \\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(D_1\\) is basically the \u201cinformation dimension\u201d (the same dimension that shows up in the Shannon\u2010type analysis).  More generally, if you define a *\\(q\\)\u2010version* of \\(I\\), you can get \\(D_q\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Which \\(D_q\\) Does \u201c\\(-\\ln p\\)\u2010Sum\u201d Correspond To?\n\n- For the usual Shannon weighting (\\(q=1\\)), the fractal dimension is often called \\(D_1\\) (the *information dimension*).  \n- Summing \\(-\\ln p\\) across *samples drawn from \\(p\\)* effectively is related to the same dimension that arises in the *Shannon* (i.e.\\ \\(q=1\\)) coarse\u2010graining approach.  \n- If you define \n  \\[\n  I_q(\\epsilon) \n  \\;=\\;\n  \\sum_{i=1}^N \\bigl[-\\ln\\bigl(p(\\mathbf{x}_i)^q\\bigr)\\bigr]\n  \\;=\\;\n  -\\,q\\,\\sum_{i=1}^N \\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i),\n  \\]\n  then as you vary \\(\\epsilon\\), you would isolate the dimension \\(D_q\\).  In practice, you may have to re\u2010weight or re\u2010normalize to interpret it carefully, but the scaling with \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) persists.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Caveats in Practice\n\n1. **You must vary \\(\\epsilon\\)**:  \n   - As with *any* fractal dimension method, you don\u2019t see the dimension from a *single* value of \\(\\epsilon\\).  You see it by changing the coarse\u2010graining scale (e.g.\\ the amplitude quantization step in your PDE state).  Then you see how \\(I(\\epsilon)\\) or \\(H(\\epsilon)\\) grows with \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\).  \n2. **Large offsets**:  \n   - \\(\\,-\\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) in a high\u2010dimensional field can be on the order of \\(10^5\\) or \\(10^6\\).  That\u2019s normal.  For dimension extraction, you look at how it *changes* with \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n3. **Multifractals**:  \n   - If the measure is *multifractal*, you get different exponents \\(D_q\\) for different \\(q\\).  Summing \u201c\\(-\\ln p\\)\u201d unmodified corresponds roughly to \\(q=1\\).  If you want *other* \\(q\\), you do a different weighting.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n**Yes**\u2014defining \n\\[\nI(\\epsilon)\\;=\\;-\\sum_{i=1}^N \\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}\\) are samples from \\(p\\), *also* yields a scaling form\n\n\\[\nI(\\epsilon)\n\\;=\\;\ni(\\epsilon) + D \\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr)\n\\]\nin the fractal case (for the appropriate dimension \\(D\\), often \\(D_1\\) if we\u2019re effectively at \\(q=1\\)). \n\nJust as with \\(H(\\epsilon)\\), the key is that *increasing resolution* (\\(\\epsilon\\to 0\\)) reveals how the measure\u2019s support is only \\(D\\)-dimensional. So while both \\(I\\) and \\(H\\) diverge as \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\), their slope in that log\u2010plot is the fractal dimension."

              "Yes \u2013 in principle you can. The idea is that for a measure supported on a fractal attractor, the coarse\u2010grained (R\u00e9nyi) entropy of order \\(q\\) scales as\n\n\\[\nH_q(\\epsilon) = h_q + D_q\\,\\ln\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr),\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) is the \\(q\\)-entropy computed by partitioning (or quantizing) the phase space at scale \\(\\epsilon\\),\n- \\(h_q\\) is the finite differential \\(q\\)-entropy (the \u201ccontinuous part\u201d),\n- \\(D_q\\) is the generalized (R\u00e9nyi) dimension of order \\(q\\).\n\nWhen you talk about the quantity\n\n\\[\nI = -\\sum \\ln p,\n\\]\n\nthat is essentially the sample-based version of the Shannon (or \\(q=1\\)) information\u2014i.e. the average surprise. For \\(q=1\\) this scaling is\n\n\\[\nI_1(\\epsilon) \\sim i_1 + D_1\\,\\ln\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr),\n\\]\n\nso that by varying \\(\\epsilon\\) (i.e. by coarse-graining your state more or less finely) you can extract the slope, which gives you the information dimension \\(D_1\\).\n\nTo generalize to other \\(q\\), you need to define the appropriate \\(q\\)-generalized information measure. For example, one standard approach is to compute the R\u00e9nyi entropy\n\n\\[\nH_q(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{1-q}\\ln \\Biggl( \\sum_b [p_b(\\epsilon)]^q \\Biggr),\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum is over bins of size \\(\\epsilon\\) in phase space. The scaling relation\n\n\\[\nH_q(\\epsilon) = h_q + D_q\\,\\ln\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr)\n\\]\n\nthen holds in the small-\\(\\epsilon\\) limit. In practice, if you already have a \u201chuge array\u201d of \\(-\\ln p\\) values (which for \\(q=1\\) is \\(I\\)), you could\u2014in principle\u2014generalize this by forming the quantity\n\n\\[\nI_q(\\epsilon) = -\\frac{1}{q-1}\\ln\\Biggl(\\sum_i [p(\\mathbf{x}_i)]^{q-1}\\,e^{-(q-1)\\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i)}\\Biggr),\n\\]\n\nor more directly by computing \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) from a binned version of your samples at various coarse\u2010graining scales. Then by fitting the linear dependence in \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\), the slope will yield \\(D_q\\).\n\nIn summary:\n\n- For \\(q=1\\), your sum \\(I = -\\sum \\ln p\\) (or its average) should scale as\n  \\[\n  I_1(\\epsilon) = i_1 + D_1\\,\\ln\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr).\n  \\]\n- For any other \\(q\\), if you define the corresponding \\(q\\)-generalized information (or R\u00e9nyi entropy) \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\), then its scaling with \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) will have a slope equal to \\(D_q\\).\n\nSo yes, if you have (or can compute) the appropriate coarse-grained \\(q\\)-information measures over a range of resolutions, you can extract \\(D_q\\) for any \\(q\\). The key is that only the *scaling* (the slope versus \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\)) matters\u2014the additive constant \\(i_q\\) does not affect the estimate of \\(D_q\\)."

              "The idea is in the right direction\u2014but there\u2019s a subtlety. In the usual coarse\u2010graining approach you deliberately change the resolution (i.e. the bin size, \\(\\epsilon\\)) used to represent the state, and then observe how the \u201cdiscrete\u201d information (or entropy) scales as\n\\[\nH_q(\\epsilon) = h_q + D_q\\ln\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr).\n\\]\n\nIf you only change the number of samples (say, by taking different-sized subsets of your trajectories), then you\u2019re not directly changing the resolution of your density estimate. In many fractal measures, the *typical distance* between points scales as\n\\[\n\\epsilon \\sim N^{-1/D},\n\\]\nso if you na\u00efvely compute the average information (i.e. \\(-\\ln p\\)) over different \\(N\\) you will often see that the average scales like\n\\[\n\\langle -\\ln p \\rangle \\sim \\ln\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr) \\sim \\frac{1}{D}\\ln(N),\n\\]\nwhich would give a log\u2010dependence on \\(N\\) but with a coefficient that does not directly reveal \\(D\\) unless you can independently relate \\(N\\) to \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\nIn other words, to extract \\(D_q\\) you really need to vary the effective resolution \\(\\epsilon\\) at which you \u201cobserve\u201d your attractor. One way to do this is to form histograms (or other density estimates) using different bin sizes (or quantization steps) in your full phase space. Simply averaging the information over different numbers of samples doesn\u2019t change the \u201cresolution\u201d of your density estimate\u2014it just gives you better statistics for the same \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\nThat said, if you can relate the number of samples \\(N\\) to an effective resolution (for example, via nearest\u2010neighbor distances) then you could use the scaling law to extract \\(D_q\\). In that case you\u2019d do something like:\n1. Estimate the typical spacing \\(\\epsilon\\) among your samples (e.g. using the average distance to the \\(k\\)th nearest neighbor).\n2. Note that for a fractal attractor, \\(\\epsilon \\sim N^{-1/D_q}\\).\n3. Use the fact that the average information scales as\n   \\[\n   \\langle -\\ln p \\rangle \\approx i_q + D_q\\ln\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr).\n   \\]\n4. Combining the two, you can relate changes in \\(\\langle -\\ln p \\rangle\\) as you change \\(N\\) and then invert the relation to estimate \\(D_q\\).\n\nSo, in summary:\n- **Directly** averaging \\(-\\ln p\\) over different numbers of samples does not automatically give you different resolutions.\n- **However**, if you can determine how the effective resolution \\(\\epsilon\\) scales with \\(N\\), you can use that information in your scaling relation to recover \\(D_q\\).\n\nThus, one form of coarse\u2010graining is indeed to change the effective resolution (whether by explicitly binning at different scales or by subsampling *and* measuring the effective spacing). Without an independent estimate of how \\(\\epsilon\\) depends on \\(N\\), simply averaging over different numbers of samples will not in itself isolate the fractal dimension."

              "Ok, now let's put it all together. The objective is to recover the spectrum of D_q values for arbitrary q.\n\nWhat we have is the final information (-log p) value for each of N trajectories sampled from a Gaussian distribution. We can make the assumption that running the simulation to get the final states is equivalent to sampling from the fractal attractor in phase space. For each simulation, we have discretized space and time to find values of H, W, and \\Delta T in order to be able to compute the final values of information. \n\nNow that we've computed the information (-log p) values for each of the trajectories we have a distribution of information values. This distribution should be able to tell us the discretized q-entropy. However, since our I values are very large, we can't actually compute it naively since the exp can't handle the incredible precision needed for calculating exp(-1e7). Instead, to get the qth Renyi Dimension, we will use the sum over the information and not the expectation of it, as we just discussed. \n\nThe challenge now is, what is epsilon exactly? What is the correct variable to vary that corresponds to increasing resolution? Is it the states themselves? Is it something to do with the number of states we sample? Something else? Come up with a few possible definitions for epsilon and why they do or do not work. Then, give me an explicit method for calculating the qth R\u00e9nyi Dimension using the sum-of-log-probs approach.

              "Below is a higher\u2010level plan (with concrete suggestions) for how to define \\(\\epsilon\\) in a *sum\u2010of\u2010log\u2010prob* approach and then use it to extract the full Renyi dimension spectrum \\(D_q\\). The key point is always: **fractal (multifractal) dimension requires observing how the measure \u201cpacks\u201d itself as your \u201cresolution\u201d in phase space changes**. That resolution is precisely your \\(\\epsilon\\). You cannot get the scaling from a single discretization alone\u2014 you need multiple scales.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why \\(\\epsilon\\) Must Be a \u201cResolution\u201d in Phase Space\n\nWhen you say\n\\[\nH_q(\\epsilon) \n\\;=\\; \nh_q + D_q\\,\\ln \\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr),\n\\]\nyou\u2019re summarizing that the coarse\u2010grained (\\(\\epsilon\\)\u2010binned) entropy or information grows *linearly* with \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\). Equivalently, in a *sum\u2010of\u2010log\u2010probs* style approach, you\u2019ll get\n\\[\nI_q(\\epsilon) \n\\;=\\; \ni_q \n\\;+\\; \nD_q \\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr).\n\\]\nBut to do a *numerical* measurement of \\(D_q\\), you need a handle on \\(\\epsilon\\) and a way to **vary** it systematically.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Some Possible Definitions of \\(\\epsilon\\)\n\nThink of \\(\\epsilon\\) as the \u201cbin size\u201d (or \u201cquantization size\u201d) in your system\u2019s *full phase space*. You have a PDE or large ODE with \\(d = H \\times W\\) degrees of freedom (the amplitude at each grid point). Each amplitude is stored at some precision (e.g., 32\u2010bit float). \n\n### 2.1 Varying the **amplitude quantization** per grid cell\n\n1. **Coarse**: Suppose you only store each amplitude with 8 bits. That means each amplitude coordinate is binned into \\(2^8 = 256\\) levels, i.e. \\(\\delta \\approx 1/256\\).  \n2. **Finer**: Then store 16 bits (\\(\\delta \\approx 1/65536\\)).  \n3. **Even finer**: 32 bits, etc.\n\n- **Interpretation**: Now \\(\\epsilon = \\delta\\) is your \u201cstep size\u201d in *each dimension* of the PDE state vector. In the full \\(d\\)\u2010dimensional space, that implies \\(\\epsilon^{-d}\\) total bins\u2014 but your fractal measure only \u201coccupies\u201d \\(\\epsilon^{-D_q}\\).  \n- **Pro**: It\u2019s straightforward if you can easily reduce or control the amplitude resolution at output time (or during data post\u2010processing).  \n- **Con**: You might need to re\u2010run or re\u2010quantize your data at multiple precisions.\n\nIf your PDE is on a fixed \\(H\\times W\\) spatial grid, then for each amplitude resolution \\(\\delta\\), you compute the discrete measure (and from that measure, the sum of \\(-\\log p\\), etc.). Then you plot that sum or coarse\u2010grained entropy versus \\(\\ln(1/\\delta)\\). The slope = \\(D_q\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Varying the **spatial grid** (refining \\(H,W\\)) while keeping amplitude precision fixed\n\n1. Solve your PDE on a \\(64\\times64\\) grid, find final states, compute \\(-\\log p\\).  \n2. Solve on a \\(128\\times128\\) grid.  \n3. Solve on a \\(256\\times256\\) grid, etc.\n\n- **Interpretation**: As you refine the *physical* mesh, you also increase the *dimension* of your discretized state vector. The effective \u201cphase\u2010space cell size\u201d might scale like \\(\\epsilon \\sim 1/\\sqrt{HW}\\) or something along those lines if each amplitude\u2019s range stays the same but the number of \u201cpixels\u201d grows.  \n- **Pro**: Common in PDE studies: you want to see how the fractal set emerges as your PDE simulation becomes more physically accurate.  \n- **Con**: More computationally expensive to re\u2010run at multiple large grids. Also, the interpretation of \u201c\\(\\epsilon\\)\u201d must be pinned down carefully (is it 1/number_of_gridpoints? Or the physical step \\(\\Delta x\\)?). \n\nNevertheless, if your attractor truly has dimension \\(D_q\\ll d\\), you\u2019ll see that as you refine the grid, the measure\u2019s *discrete* entropies or sum\u2010of\u2010log\u2010probs do not blow up as fast as a full \\(d\\)\u2010dimensional measure would. The difference in slopes reveals \\(D_q\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 **Artificial binning** of the PDE solution vector\n\nEven if you keep a single \\(H\\times W\\) and single amplitude precision in the actual PDE code, you can **post\u2010process** your final states or intermediate states at multiple binning levels in \u201cphase space.\u201d For instance:\n\n1. Let each PDE state be a vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) with \\(d=H\\times W\\).  \n2. Choose a grid of hypercubes in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) of side \\(\\epsilon\\). (Of course, \\(d\\) is large, so maybe you do something more adaptive than a naive uniform bin!)  \n3. For each \\(\\epsilon\\), group the PDE samples \\(\\{\\mathbf{u}_i\\}\\) into these bins. Then compute the discrete measure \\(p_{b}(\\epsilon)\\). From that, you can compute \\(\\sum -\\ln p_b\\) or \\(\\sum [p_b]^q\\) for the Renyi approach.  \n\n- **Pro**: Very direct \u201ccoarse\u2010grain\u201d in phase space, close to the theoretical definition.  \n- **Con**: In high dimension, naive uniform binning is impossible to store. You\u2019d need an adaptive or local approach (like a k\u2010d tree or hash of only the bins that are populated).  \n\nStill, conceptually, \\(\\epsilon\\) is the side\u2010length of the hypercubes in your PDE state space.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Which Approaches Are \u201cCorrect\u201d or \u201cNot Correct\u201d?\n\n- **Correct in principle**: any procedure that systematically refines your resolution \\(\\epsilon\\) in *phase space* and measures the resulting (coarse\u2010grained) entropies or (sum of log\u2010probs) will show the scaling with \\(D_q\\).  \n- **Feasibility**: in practice, you choose whichever approach is easiest to implement with your PDE data:\n  - If re\u2010running at multiple grid sizes is feasible, do it.  \n  - Or do **artificial amplitude quantization** of each PDE snapshot: that\u2019s often the simplest post\u2010processing method.  \n  - Or do an adaptive binning if you can manage it.\n\nThe \u201cnot correct\u201d scenario is to treat \\(\\epsilon\\) as \u201cjust the 1/N of sampling.\u201d For fractal dimension, **sample size** alone (i.e. the number of final states) does not automatically define the scale in phase space. Doubling the number of Monte Carlo runs at the *same* PDE resolution does *not* reduce the \u201cbin width.\u201d It only gives you a better sampling of the same \u201cbins.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4. Explicit Method to Estimate \\(D_q\\) via Sum of \\(-\\log p\\)\n\nAssume you pick a strategy for \\(\\epsilon\\) (e.g., amplitude quantization). Let\u2019s outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. **Generate PDE states** at the final time (or times) from *N* independent runs (trajectories), presumably sampling the attractor.  \n2. For each *quantization level* \\(\\epsilon_k\\) (coarser to finer):\n   1. **Assign** each PDE state \\(\\mathbf{u}_i\\) to a \u201cbin\u201d in phase space.  \n   2. **Compute** the probability of each bin: \n      \\[\n      p_b(\\epsilon_k) = \\frac{1}{N}\\,(\\text{number of states that fall in bin }b).\n      \\]\n   3. **Compute** the discrete measure for that level:\n      \\[\n      p_b(\\epsilon_k)^q \\quad \\text{(for each bin), or} \\quad -\\ln p_b(\\epsilon_k).\n      \\]\n   4. **Sum** to get the *coarse\u2010grained* Renyi entropy or information:\n      \\[\n      I(\\epsilon_k) \\;=\\; -\\sum_{i=1}^N \\ln p_{\\text{bin}(\\mathbf{u}_i)}(\\epsilon_k),\n      \\]\n      or equivalently,\n      \\[\n      H_q(\\epsilon_k) = \\frac{1}{1-q}\\,\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\sum_b [p_b(\\epsilon_k)]^q \\bigr),\n      \\]\n      depending on which expression you prefer. They are inter\u2010convertible (with some constants).\n3. **Plot** \\(I(\\epsilon_k)\\) (or \\(H_q(\\epsilon_k)\\)) versus \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon_k)\\). You should see an approximately linear regime for small \\(\\epsilon_k\\).  \n4. **Fit** the slope: that slope is your fractal dimension \\(D_q\\).  \n\n### 4.1 If You Already Have \\(-\\ln p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) from PDE\n\n- You might skip the bin\u2010count step, because you say you have \u201c\\(-\\log p(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\).\u201d But be careful: that is the continuous\u2010space \\(\\log p\\). You still need a scheme to interpret changes in *discretization scale* \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n- A more direct route: artificially *truncate* or *round* the PDE\u2019s states to different precisions. Then re\u2010compute \\(-\\log p\\) accordingly (or re\u2010interpret it). This still amounts to coarsening.  \n\nIn any case, the critical piece is you do this **for multiple** \\(\\epsilon\\) values. A single histogram of \\(-\\log p\\) at one resolution can\u2019t give you the slope that defines \\(D_q\\).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of Epsilon Choices\n\n- **Amplitude bin size** \\(\\delta\\): E.g., store PDE fields at 8\u2010bit, 16\u2010bit, 32\u2010bit, etc. \\(\\delta = 1/2^{(\\text{bit depth})}\\).  \n- **Spatial grid** \\(\\Delta x\\): E.g., run PDE at \\(64^2\\), \\(128^2\\), \\(256^2\\), so \u201c\\(\\epsilon\\) \\sim 1/(HW)\\)\u201d or something that reflects the high\u2010dim \u201cphase\u2010space cell.\u201d  \n- **Adaptive or uniform** binning in the PDE solution space**: If you can do a uniform partition in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) of side \\(\\epsilon\\). (Practical only with some data structure in large \\(d\\).)\n\nAll are valid in principle\u2014**as long as** you measure the *coarse\u2010grained distribution* at each scale and see how the resulting (log) sums scale with \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\).\n\n---\n\n## Final Takeaway\n\n1. **You must define \\(\\epsilon\\) as the coarse\u2010graining scale** in the PDE\u2019s *phase space.*  \n2. **You must vary \\(\\epsilon\\)** (coarse to fine) and measure how your sum\u2010of\u2010log\u2010probs (or discrete Renyi entropy) changes.  \n3. **From the slope** of that linear relationship with \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\), **you recover \\(D_q\\)**.  \n\nThat\u2019s how you systematically get the entire *spectrum* of \\(D_q\\) from your PDE data without directly doing correlation sums in the original (possibly huge) dimension."

              "Below is an overview of two explicit methods\u2014one using spatial discretization and one using bit discretization\u2014to \u201ccoarse\u2010grain\u201d your phase\u2010space measure, followed by a sample PyTorch function that implements bit discretization on an (N, H, W) tensor.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Two Methods for Coarse\u2010Graining\n\n### (A) **Spatial Discretization**\n\n**Idea:**  \nYou run your simulation on grids of various spatial resolutions (e.g. 64\u00d764, 128\u00d7128, 256\u00d7256). In each run the PDE state is represented as a vector of length H\u00d7W. The \u201cresolution\u201d here is the spacing of the spatial grid, say \u0394x (which might be ~1/H if your domain is fixed). This spatial resolution determines the \u201ccell\u2010size\u201d in the high-dimensional phase space. Although increasing the spatial resolution increases the overall dimension, if your attractor is fractal the *effective* number of populated bins scales like  \n\\[\n\\epsilon^{-D_q}\\quad\\text{instead of}\\quad\\epsilon^{-H\\times W},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon\\) is related to the spatial grid spacing (or, more generally, to the discretization cell size in phase space).\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. **Simulate at multiple grid sizes:** For example, run simulations at 64\u00d764, 128\u00d7128, and 256\u00d7256.\n2. **Compute final states:** For each grid resolution, compute the final state \\(A(x)\\).\n3. **Define bins:**  \n   \u2013 The coarse\u2010graining scale \\(\\epsilon\\) can be taken as the effective \u201ccell size\u201d in phase space. For instance, if each grid cell is treated independently and the amplitudes are measured with a fixed precision, then \\(\\epsilon\\) might be proportional to the spatial step \u0394x.\n4. **Compute probabilities:** Bin the final state data (or use your pre\u2010computed \\(-\\log p\\) values) to compute the discrete probabilities \\(p_b(\\epsilon)\\).\n5. **Calculate Renyi entropy:** For order \\(q\\),\n   \\[\n   H_q(\\epsilon)=\\frac{1}{1-q}\\,\\ln\\Bigl(\\sum_{b} [p_b(\\epsilon)]^q\\Bigr).\n   \\]\n6. **Extract \\(D_q\\):** Plot \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) versus \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\). In the scaling regime,\n   \\[\n   H_q(\\epsilon)= h_q + D_q\\,\\ln\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr),\n   \\]\n   so the slope of the linear region is the \\(q\\)th R\u00e9nyi dimension.\n\n---\n\n### (B) **Bit Discretization**\n\n**Idea:**  \nEven if you run your simulation on a fixed spatial grid, you can \u201cartificially\u201d coarsen (or refine) the representation of each state by quantizing the amplitudes to different bit depths. For example, you might re\u2010quantize the amplitude of each grid point using 8 bits, 12 bits, 16 bits, etc. The effective bin width in each amplitude dimension is then\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\text{(max\\_val\u2013min\\_val)}}{2^{\\text{bits}}-1}\\,.\n\\]\nA coarser quantization (lower bit depth) corresponds to a larger \\(\\epsilon\\) and vice versa. By \u201cre\u2010binning\u201d your final states at various bit precisions, you get a family of coarse\u2010grained measures.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. **Collect final states:** You have an (N, H, W) tensor representing your simulation outcomes.\n2. **Quantize the amplitudes:** For each chosen bit depth (which determines \\(\\epsilon\\)), re\u2010quantize the state values.  \n   \u2013 For example, if your state values lie in [min_val, max_val] (say, normalized to [0, 1]), then using 8 bits means 256 discrete levels.\n3. **Assign bins:** Each state (or each grid cell in a state) now falls into one of the bins defined by the quantization.\n4. **Compute discrete probabilities:** Over all trajectories, determine the probability of each distinct bin.\n5. **Compute the qth R\u00e9nyi entropy using the sum over log\u2010probs:**  \n   \u2013 If you wish to avoid numerical overflow from taking exp of huge numbers, you can use the sum of \\(-\\log p\\) values from your data.\n6. **Extract \\(D_q\\):** As before, by plotting your coarse\u2010grained entropy \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\) (or \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\)) versus \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) you obtain a linear scaling region. The slope gives you the \\(q\\)th R\u00e9nyi dimension.\n\n---\n\n## 2. A PyTorch Function for Bit Discretization\n\nBelow is an example Python function using PyTorch that accepts an (N, H, W) tensor of states and a specified bit depth. This function assumes the states are normalized to lie in a fixed range (default [0, 1]) and returns the discretized states along with the effective \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef bit_discretize(states: torch.Tensor, bits: int, min_val: float = 0.0, max_val: float = 1.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Discretizes the input tensor of states using bit quantization.\n\n    Args:\n        states (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (N, H, W) representing the PDE states.\n                               It is assumed that the states lie within [min_val, max_val].\n        bits (int): The number of bits to use for discretization.\n        min_val (float): Minimum value in the range of the states (default 0.0).\n        max_val (float): Maximum value in the range of the states (default 1.0).\n\n    Returns:\n        discretized (torch.Tensor): The discretized states with the same shape as input.\n        epsilon (float): The effective bin width, i.e., the quantization resolution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure states are within the given range\n    states_clipped = torch.clamp(states, min=min_val, max=max_val)\n    \n    # Compute number of bins based on bit depth.\n    # For example, 8 bits -> 2^8 - 1 = 255 (or you can use 256 bins).\n    num_bins = 2 ** bits - 1\n    \n    # Effective bin width epsilon (resolution)\n    epsilon = (max_val - min_val) / num_bins\n\n    # Normalize states to [0, num_bins] and then round.\n    states_normalized = (states_clipped - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)\n    # Multiply by num_bins and round to nearest integer\n    states_quantized = torch.round(states_normalized * num_bins)\n    \n    # Optionally, map quantized values back to [min_val, max_val]\n    discretized = states_quantized / num_bins * (max_val - min_val) + min_val\n    \n    return discretized, epsilon\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Create a dummy (N, H, W) tensor with values in [0, 1]\n    N, H, W = 1000, 64, 64\n    states = torch.rand(N, H, W)\n    \n    bits = 8  # Try with 8-bit quantization\n    discretized_states, eps = bit_discretize(states, bits)\n    print(f\"Effective epsilon (bin width) with {bits} bits: {eps}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Putting It All Together for Estimating \\(D_q\\)\n\n**Step-by-Step Summary:**\n\n1. **Collect Data:**  \n   Run your simulation and obtain an (N, H, W) tensor of final states.\n\n2. **Choose a Range of \\(\\epsilon\\) Values:**  \n   You can do this by either:\n   - Varying the bit depth (e.g., 6, 8, 10, 12 bits), or  \n   - Varying the spatial grid resolution if you can re-run the simulation.\n\n3. **For Each \\(\\epsilon\\):**  \n   - Use the chosen discretization method (e.g. the bit_discretize function) to quantize your state data.\n   - Compute the discrete probability measure \\(p_b(\\epsilon)\\). This might involve counting how many states (or how many grid points across states) fall into each bin.\n   - Compute the qth R\u00e9nyi entropy. One way is to compute  \n     \\[\n     H_q(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{1-q} \\ln\\Bigl(\\sum_b [p_b(\\epsilon)]^q\\Bigr)\n     \\]\n     or, if you wish to avoid taking exponentials, use a formulation based on the sum of \\(-\\ln p\\) values.\n   \n4. **Extract \\(D_q\\):**  \n   Plot your computed entropy \\(H_q(\\epsilon)\\) (or the sum-of-log-probs version \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\)) versus \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\). The scaling region should be linear:\n   \\[\n   H_q(\\epsilon) \\approx h_q + D_q \\ln\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr).\n   \\]\n   The slope of this linear fit gives you \\(D_q\\).\n\n---\n\nBy systematically varying the quantization resolution (i.e. \\(\\epsilon\\)) and observing how your computed entropy scales, you can recover the full spectrum of R\u00e9nyi dimensions \\(D_q\\) without resorting to expensive correlation or box\u2010counting methods directly on the high-dimensional field."

              "**Modifying sum-of-log-probs**\n\nThe task requires using I_q instead of H_q, which refers to modifying the method where we previously used the sum of log-probabilities. We've looked at two methods \u2014 spatial discretization and bit discretization \u2014 and now we need to apply the sum-of-log-probs approach with I_q. I recall the relation: I_q(\\epsilon) = i_q + D_q ln(1/\\epsilon), where I_q is related to the q-moment of the information values. I'll plan a step-by-step modification and create a Python function for this.\n\n**Clarifying I_q and H_q**\n\nOkay, looking carefully at the definitions \u2014 H_q is (1/(1-q)) ln(\u03a3 p_i^q), while the sum-of-log-probs gives the average of -log p_i. For q=1, I_q is similar to -\u03a3 log p_i, but for other q, we need a generalization. The task asks to modify this to use I_q instead of H_q. I think this could be done by defining I_q as a weighted sum of log probabilities, similar to the Chhabra-Jensen method, using the q-th moment approach for Renyi dimensions. I\u2019ll work on detailing this.\n\n**Computing I_q for Renyi dimensions**\n\nFor I_q, we start with I_q(\u03b5) = -\u03a3 log p_i(\u03b5), possibly weighted. As \u03b5 changes, the slope in ln(1/\u03b5) gives D_q. For general q, we need to compute a weighted q-th average information: I_q(\u03b5) = \u03a3 w_i^q (- log p_i). The weights are w_i^q = p(x_i)^q / \u03a3 p(x_j)^q. This method relates to the Chhabra-Jensen scheme, but requires a minor tweak for q\u22601. The procedure involves calculating normalized weights, then summing the weighted log probabilities. I'll implement this in Python."

The Basic Idea\n\nFor a measure supported on a fractal attractor, if you \u201ccoarse\u2011grain\u201d (i.e. bin) the full state with resolution \\(\\epsilon\\) (which you can vary by, for example, changing the effective bit\u2010depth of each grid cell), then the coarse\u2011grained information\n\\[\nI_q(\\epsilon) = \\sum_b \\mu_b^{(q)} \\Bigl[-\\ln p_b(\\epsilon)\\Bigr]\n\\]\nscales as\n\\[\nI_q(\\epsilon) = i_q + D_q\\,\\ln\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr),\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(p_b(\\epsilon)\\) is the probability of \u201cbin\u201d \\(b\\) (the fraction of your trajectories whose discretized state falls in bin \\(b\\)),\n- \\(\\mu_b^{(q)} = \\dfrac{p_b(\\epsilon)^q}{\\sum_b p_b(\\epsilon)^q}\\) is the \\(q\\)-weighted probability,\n- \\(i_q\\) is a constant (the \u201cdifferential\u201d part), and\n- \\(D_q\\) is the \\(q\\)th R\u00e9nyi (or multifractal) dimension.\n\nThus, by varying \\(\\epsilon\\) (i.e. by using different levels of quantization) and computing \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\), you can extract the slope in a plot of \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\) versus \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\); that slope is \\(D_q\\).\n\n### 2. How to Vary \\(\\epsilon\\)\n\nYou have two practical choices:\n\n#### (A) **Spatial Discretization**\n\nYou run the simulation on different spatial grids (e.g. \\(64 \\times 64\\), \\(128 \\times 128\\), \\(256 \\times 256\\), etc.). In this case the \u201cresolution\u201d \\(\\epsilon\\) is tied to the physical grid spacing. For example, if your spatial domain is fixed, then \\(\\Delta x\\sim1/H\\) (or similarly for \\(W\\)); the effective resolution in phase space is then determined by both the grid spacing and the quantization used for the amplitude at each grid point.\n\n#### (B) **Bit Discretization (Amplitude Quantization)**\n\nEven at fixed spatial resolution, you can \u201cartificially\u201d vary \\(\\epsilon\\) by re\u2011quantizing the amplitude at each grid cell to different bit depths. For example, if your states are normalized to \\([0,1]\\):\n- Using 8 bits means \\(2^8 = 256\\) levels, so the effective bin width is roughly\n  \\[\n  \\epsilon = \\frac{1-0}{2^8-1}\\,.\n  \\]\n- Using 12 bits or 16 bits gives a smaller \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\nAs you decrease \\(\\epsilon\\) (by increasing the bit depth), you are probing finer resolution in the full state space. Then for each \\(\\epsilon\\) you compute the discretized measure and \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\).\n\n> **Note:** Varying the total number of trajectories \\(N\\) (i.e. increasing the sample size) does not change the bin size in phase space. Only changing the quantization (either via spatial grid refinement or amplitude bit-depth) changes \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Explicit Method (Using Bit Discretization)\n\n**Step 1.** For each chosen bit depth:\n- Re\u2011quantize (discretize) your (N,H,W) states. We will represent each state \u201cpixel\u201d as an integer in \\(\\{0,1,\\ldots,2^{\\text{bits}}-1\\}\\). The effective bin width is\n  \\[\n  \\epsilon = \\frac{\\text{max\\_val} - \\text{min\\_val}}{2^{\\text{bits}}-1}\\,.\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2.** Treat each trajectory (i.e. each (H,W) discretized state) as a single point in phase space. Flatten it to a vector of length \\(H\\times W\\). Count the number of occurrences of each unique state (i.e. each unique bin in the high\u2011dimensional space). This gives you the discrete probabilities\n\\[\np_b = \\frac{\\text{count of bin }b}{N}\\,.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3.** For a given order \\(q\\), compute the \\(q\\)-weighted measure:\n\\[\n\\mu_b^{(q)} = \\frac{p_b^q}{\\sum_b p_b^q}\\,.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4.** Compute the weighted sum of the \u201csurprise\u201d (information):\n\\[\nI_q(\\epsilon) = \\sum_b \\mu_b^{(q)} \\Bigl[-\\ln p_b\\Bigr]\\,.\n\\]\n\n**Step 5.** Repeat for a range of bit depths (and hence \\(\\epsilon\\)). Then plot \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\) versus \\(\\ln\\bigl(1/\\epsilon\\bigr)\\) and fit the linear region; the slope is \\(D_q\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Python Functions (Using PyTorch)\n\nBelow are two functions:\n- **`bit_discretize_int`** quantizes an (N,H,W) tensor to a given bit depth and returns an integer tensor along with the effective \\(\\epsilon\\).\n- **`compute_Iq`** computes \\(I_q\\) from the discretized states by counting unique states.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef bit_discretize_int(states: torch.Tensor, bits: int, min_val: float = 0.0, max_val: float = 1.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Discretizes the input tensor of states using bit quantization, returning integer labels.\n    \n    Args:\n        states (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (N, H, W) with state values.\n                               It is assumed that the states lie within [min_val, max_val].\n        bits (int): Number of bits for discretization.\n        min_val (float): Minimum expected state value (default 0.0).\n        max_val (float): Maximum expected state value (default 1.0).\n    \n    Returns:\n        discretized (torch.Tensor): Integer tensor of shape (N, H, W) with values in {0,..., 2**bits - 1}.\n        epsilon (float): Effective bin width.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clamp states to [min_val, max_val]\n    states_clipped = torch.clamp(states, min=min_val, max=max_val)\n    \n    # Number of bins: using 2**bits discrete levels.\n    num_bins = 2 ** bits - 1  # or you might use 2**bits if you prefer\n    \n    # Effective bin width:\n    epsilon = (max_val - min_val) / num_bins\n    \n    # Normalize states to [0, num_bins] and round to nearest integer.\n    states_normalized = (states_clipped - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)\n    states_int = torch.round(states_normalized * num_bins).to(torch.int64)\n    \n    return states_int, epsilon\n\ndef compute_Iq(discretized_states: torch.Tensor, q: float):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the q-th order weighted sum-of-log-probs (I_q) from discretized states.\n    \n    Here, each trajectory (of shape (H, W)) is flattened into a 1D vector,\n    and the unique state counts are used to compute probabilities.\n    \n    Args:\n        discretized_states (torch.Tensor): Integer tensor of shape (N, H, W).\n        q (float): The order q for the R\u00e9nyi dimension computation.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Iq (float): The computed I_q value.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = discretized_states.shape[0]\n    # Flatten each state into a 1D vector; shape becomes (N, H*W)\n    states_flat = discretized_states.view(N, -1)\n    \n    # Find unique states and counts along dimension 0.\n    # Note: For high-dimensional states, the number of unique states may be very large,\n    # but if the attractor is low-dimensional, many states will repeat.\n    unique_states, counts = torch.unique(states_flat, dim=0, return_counts=True)\n    \n    # Convert counts to probabilities (p_b)\n    p_b = counts.to(torch.float64) / N  # shape: (num_unique_states,)\n    \n    # Compute the q-weighted measure: mu_b^(q) = p_b^q / sum(p_b^q)\n    # (For q = 1, this reduces to p_b.)\n    p_b_q = p_b ** q\n    mu_b = p_b_q / torch.sum(p_b_q)\n    \n    # Compute the weighted average information (surprise): I_q = sum(mu_b * (-ln(p_b)))\n    Iq = torch.sum(mu_b * (-torch.log(p_b)))\n    \n    # Return as a standard Python float.\n    return Iq.item()\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Create a dummy (N, H, W) tensor of states in [0, 1]\n    N, H, W = 1000, 64, 64\n    states = torch.rand(N, H, W)\n    \n    # Choose a bit depth, e.g., 8 bits.\n    bits = 8\n    discretized_states, epsilon = bit_discretize_int(states, bits)\n    print(f\"Bit discretization with {bits} bits yields epsilon = {epsilon}\")\n    \n    # Compute I_q for q = 1 (information dimension)\n    q = 1.0\n    I1 = compute_Iq(discretized_states, q)\n    print(f\"I_{q} = {I1}\")\n    \n    # To extract D_q, repeat for several bit depths (varying epsilon),\n    # then plot I_q versus ln(1/epsilon) and fit a line. The slope is D_q.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of the Procedure\n\n1. **Vary the resolution \\(\\epsilon\\)** by changing the bit depth (or spatial grid resolution) used to quantize your state.\n2. **For each \\(\\epsilon\\):**\n   - Quantize your (N,H,W) states using `bit_discretize_int`.\n   - Flatten each state and count unique occurrences to form the discrete measure \\(p_b\\).\n   - Compute the \\(q\\)-weighted sum-of-log\u2011probabilities \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\) via `compute_Iq`.\n3. **Plot \\(I_q(\\epsilon)\\) vs. \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\).** In the scaling regime, the relation\n   \\[\n   I_q(\\epsilon) \\approx i_q + D_q\\,\\ln\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Bigr)\n   \\]\n   holds. Fitting a straight line to this plot yields \\(D_q\\) as the slope.\n4. **Repeat for various \\(q\\) values** to recover the full spectrum \\(D_q\\).\n\nThis method lets you use the \u201csum-of-log\u2011probs\u201d approach (i.e. \\(I_q\\)) to extract the fractal dimensions without directly computing exponentials of huge numbers."

              "# Evolution of Liouville-Equation Approaches in Chaos Theory\n\n## Early Foundations (Pre-1960)  \nThe idea of using phase-space distributions to study dynamics dates back to classical mechanics. Liouville\u2019s theorem (1838) established that Hamiltonian systems preserve phase-space volume (the **Liouville measure**), meaning the measure of any region in phase space remains constant during motion\u301038\u2020L7-L11\u3011. Early 20th-century mathematicians like \u00c9mile Borel and Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi hinted that even simple deterministic maps can exhibit \u201crandom\u201d behavior\u301028\u2020L51-L58\u3011. These insights were mostly theoretical curiosities until the mid-20th century. In 1958\u201359, **A.N. Kolmogorov** and **Ya. Sinai** introduced *entropy* as a measure of unpredictability in phase space, laying a rigorous foundation for chaos quantification\u301040\u2020L1-L4\u3011. Their *Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy* formalism treated a dynamical system as a measure-preserving transformation (assuming Liouville\u2019s volume conservation in conservative cases) and quantified the rate of information production in chaotic motions.\n\n## Emergence of Chaos and Strange Attractors (1960s\u20131970s)  \nBy the 1960s, the availability of computers led to the discovery of *deterministic chaos* in nonlinear systems\u301028\u2020L53-L59\u3011. A landmark was **Edward Lorenz\u2019s 1963** paper, where a simple 3-variable weather model produced an aperiodic trajectory converging to a \u201cbutterfly\u201d attractor. This *Lorenz attractor* was later recognized as a **strange attractor** \u2013 a fractal set in phase space on which the system\u2019s long-term behavior lives. Such systems are *dissipative*: phase volumes shrink due to friction or feedback, violating Liouville\u2019s volume preservation. All trajectories collapse onto the attractor, so Liouville\u2019s theorem no longer holds globally. Instead, one must consider an **invariant density** supported on the attractor (a singular measure). For example, the logistic map at its chaotic parameter shows ergodic behavior on [0,1], but not all states are equally weighted \u2013 a non-uniform invariant density forms\u301014\u2020L79-L87\u3011. Mathematicians Sinai, Ruelle, and Bowen formalized this by proving that many chaotic dissipative systems admit a natural invariant measure (now called the **SRB measure**) concentrated on their fractal attractors. In parallel, **Ruelle & Takens (1971)** conjectured that turbulence arises via strange attractors, cementing the idea that chaos could explain complex physical phenomena. By the late 1970s, theorists like **Ya. Pesin (1977)** linked local instability to entropy, proving that the KS entropy of a smooth system equals the sum of its positive Lyapunov exponents (a major breakthrough connecting phase-space divergence rates to information production).\n\n## Probabilistic Phase-Space Approaches (1970s\u20131980s)  \nDuring the 1970s, researchers began explicitly using Liouville\u2019s equation (or its discrete-time analog, the Frobenius\u2013Perron operator) to analyze chaotic maps and flows. Rather than follow individual trajectories (which diverge exponentially in chaos), they studied the evolution of an initial **density** $\\rho(p,q,t)$ in phase space\u301030\u2020L75-L84\u3011. **O. Rechard (1956)** had earlier pioneered this approach for 1D maps, raising fundamental questions about the existence and uniqueness of invariant densities\u301030\u2020L79-L87\u3011. Building on that, **Lasota & Yorke (1973)** proved general criteria for when a chaotic map has a smooth invariant density, and computational methods (like Ulam\u2019s method) emerged to approximate the Frobenius\u2013Perron operator\u301030\u2020L91-L98\u3011. This probabilistic viewpoint was crucial for dissipative chaos: it bypassed sensitive dependence on initial conditions by tracking how an ensemble of states \u201csmears out\u201d and settles onto an attractor. By the 1980s, these ideas coalesced into a clearer picture of chaos. In a famous review, **Eckmann & Ruelle (1985)** highlighted that chaotic attractors are characterized by a **spectrum of Lyapunov exponents**, a fractal dimension, and a positive entropy rate \u2013 all interrelated\u301012\u2020L57-L65\u3011. They and others showed how a strange attractor\u2019s fractal geometry (Hausdorff or information dimension), its invariant measure, and its entropy production are quantitatively linked (e.g. by formulas like the Kaplan\u2013Yorke dimension conjecture and Pesin\u2019s theorem). Researchers also developed algorithms to compute these invariants from data (e.g. Grassberger-Procaccia for fractal dimension), reflecting a shift toward measuring the *entropy of attractors* and their fractal measures in experiments. The overarching trend was that chaos theory moved from abstract existence proofs to concrete calculations of phase-space metrics \u2013 effectively using Liouville\u2019s phase-space evolution concept to quantify how \u201cmixed\u201d or \u201cthin\u201d the distribution on an attractor becomes.\n\n## Fractals, Entropy, and Liouville Density in Practice (1980s\u20131990s)  \nAnother key development was recognizing the **fractal structures** produced by Liouville evolution in chaotic systems. As a chaotic *Hamiltonian* system evolves, any blob of initial conditions stretches and folds indefinitely in phase space, creating filaments \u2013 a fine-scale mixing that yields fractal patterns in the density. A striking example was given by **Peres & Terno (1995)**, who studied an area-preserving chaotic map on a sphere. They expanded a Liouville density in spherical harmonics and showed that as the map iterates, the number of significant expansion coefficients grows *exponentially* \u2013 the density develops ever-finer structures\u30104\u2020L8-L16\u3011. To quantify this spread, they defined an entropy-like measure $S$ (analogous to quantum entropy), essentially counting the effective number of basis functions in the distribution\u30102\u2020L127-L135\u3011. In their simulations, $S$ increased linearly in time once chaos set in, reflecting the constant production of new structure in the phase-space distribution\u30102\u2020L143-L151\u3011. This exemplified how Liouville\u2019s equation can be used to **measure entropy growth** in classical chaos, and highlighted a contrast to quantum systems (which, due to discrete spectra, do not exhibit unbounded complexity in state space). Meanwhile, researchers like **Hao, H\u00e9non, and Mandelbrot** characterized fractal attractors geometrically, and others connected these fractal measures to information theory. **Multifractal analysis** of strange attractor measures became a popular approach in the late 1980s, revealing that invariant densities often have a spectrum of singularity exponents (an advanced measure-theoretic description of how $\\rho(p,q)$ varies on the attractor).\n\n## Chaos and Nonequilibrium: Liouville in the 1990s  \nIn the 1990s, phase-space (Liouville) methods proved especially fruitful in statistical physics and fluid dynamics. Researchers like **P. Gaspard** and **J. R. Dorfman** leveraged the Liouville equation to link microscopic chaos with macroscopic transport. One notable approach was the **escape-rate formalism**, where an open chaotic system (e.g. a particle in a scatterer with absorbing boundaries) is analyzed via its phase-space repeller. Gaspard showed that the rate at which probability \u201cescapes\u201d from a chaotic repeller (solved via the Liouville equation for that flow) can be equated to a macroscopic diffusion or reaction rate\u301017\u2020L57-L66\u3011. This yielded elegant formulas relating transport coefficients to chaotic invariants: for instance, diffusion coefficients or chemical reaction rates could be expressed in terms of the system\u2019s positive Lyapunov exponents and the fractal dimension of the invariant set\u301017\u2020L59-L66\u3011. In closed systems, similar ideas linked the slow decay modes of nonequilibrium relaxation to fractal eigenmodes of the Liouville operator\u301017\u2020L67-L75\u3011. These works were breakthroughs in demonstrating that *dissipative chaos produces fractal phase-space distributions that underpin irreversibility*. Another significant trend was the synthesis of chaos theory with thermodynamics: the **fluctuation theorem** (Evans, Cohen & Morriss 1993; Gallavotti & Cohen 1995) used the SRB invariant measure of a chaotic dynamical system to derive symmetry properties of entropy production in nonequilibrium processes. In essence, the Liouville equation for a thermostatted chaotic system (with phase-space contraction) provided a basis for understanding how microscopic chaotic trajectories generate macroscopic entropy. This period also saw practical algorithms for Liouville/Frobenius-Perron operators in higher dimensions \u2013 e.g. Ulam\u2019s method generalized with adaptive partitions \u2013 enabling approximate computation of invariant densities and mixing rates in complex systems. The application of phase-space distribution evolution extended even to fields like meteorology: ensemble weather prediction treated the initial-condition uncertainty as a density evolved by a Liouville-like equation, an idea championed by Lorenz and developed in the 1990s for atmospheric predictability. Overall, the 1990s solidified the view that **chaos + Liouville equation = a powerful framework** for bridging microscopic dynamics and statistical behavior (from fractal attractors in simple maps to transport and turbulence in extended systems).\n\n## Contemporary Advances and Trends (2000s\u2013present)  \nSince 2000, research using Liouville\u2019s equation in chaos has expanded into new domains and more complex systems. One direction is the continued refinement of **transfer-operator methods** for high-dimensional dynamics \u2013 for example, identifying coherent structures in oceanic or atmospheric flows by analyzing leading eigenfunctions of the Frobenius\u2013Perron operator. Another direction involves engineering and control: the *inverse Frobenius\u2013Perron problem* has been studied, where one designs a chaotic map to yield a desired invariant density\u301030\u2020L123-L131\u3011\u301030\u2020L132-L140\u3011. This has applications in pseudorandom number generation and signal design, illustrating the practical side of phase-space techniques. There is also growing interest in combining machine learning with Liouville-based descriptions. For instance, recent work on **physics-informed neural networks** leverages the fact that any deterministic ODE induces a Liouville PDE for the state distribution, and uses this to learn chaotic dynamics from data\u30101\u2020L17-L24\u3011. These neural operators aim to model how probability clouds evolve in chaotic systems, potentially improving long-range predictions despite chaos. Another modern development is applying fractional calculus and generalized Liouville equations to systems with memory or fractal time dynamics. Studies have formulated *fractional Liouville equations* (using fractional derivatives in time or space) to capture anomalous transport and strange kinetics in chaotic systems\u30100\u2020L7-L13\u3011. While niche, this approach connects fractal phase-space structures with fractional dynamics. In summary, the core approaches have evolved from proving that an invariant Liouville measure exists to actively computing and even designing such measures. Major breakthroughs \u2013 from recognizing strange attractors and defining KS entropy, to linking chaotic distributions with thermodynamic entropy \u2013 have paved the way. Over time, methodology shifted from qualitative insights (Poincar\u00e9\u2019s recurrence, Liouville\u2019s theorem) to quantitative tools (entropy, dimensions, Lyapunov analysis) and now to computational and hybrid techniques. The overarching trend is a deeper appreciation that **chaos is best understood via its phase-space distribution**: early researchers sought invariant measures in simple maps\u301030\u2020L79-L87\u3011, later ones measured their fractal and information properties\u301012\u2020L57-L65\u3011, and today we harness those ideas to tackle complex, real-world chaotic systems. Each era built on the Liouville equation as a unifying thread \u2013 whether to explain why a deterministic system can behave \u201crandomly,\u201d to characterize the fine structure of a strange attractor, or to predict how chaos transports energy and information in nature. \n\n**Sources:** Key historical papers and reviews as cited above include Kolmogorov (1958) and Sinai (1959) on entropy\u301040\u2020L1-L4\u3011, Rechard (1956) and Lasota & Yorke (1973) on invariant measures\u301030\u2020L79-L87\u3011, Lorenz (1963) and Ruelle & Takens (1971) on strange attractors, Eckmann & Ruelle (1985) on chaos invariants\u301012\u2020L57-L65\u3011, Peres & Terno (1995) on Liouville vs. quantum chaos\u30104\u2020L8-L16\u3011\u30102\u2020L127-L135\u3011, Gaspard & Dorfman (1995) on transport coefficients from Liouville dynamics\u301017\u2020L57-L66\u3011, and many modern studies leveraging transfer operators\u301030\u2020L91-L98\u3011 or new computational paradigms\u30101\u2020L17-L24\u3011 to advance chaos analysis. Each of these works used the language of phase-space density evolution (the Liouville or Frobenius\u2013Perron equation) to shed light on chaos, fractals, dissipation, or entropy in nonlinear systems, marking significant steps in our understanding from past to present."
