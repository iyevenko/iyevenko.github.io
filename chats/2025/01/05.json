              "First, let us write down the (one-dimensional for simplicity) Fokker\u2013Planck equation *without* diffusion (i.e., the \u201cdeterministic part\u201d):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p(x, t)}{\\partial t}\n\\,=\\,\n-\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigl[\\mu(x,t)\\,p(x,t)\\bigr].\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(p(x,t)\\) is the probability density function (PDF) of the stochastic variable \\(X_t\\), and \\(\\mu(x,t)\\) is the drift (deterministic) term. We assume there is no Brownian contribution (\\(D = 0\\)), so only advection by \\(\\mu\\) remains.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Expanding via the product rule\n\nWe apply the product rule to the term inside the spatial derivative:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\bigl[\\mu(x,t)\\,p(x,t)\\bigr]\n=\n- \\Bigl[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mu(x,t)}{\\partial x}\\,p(x,t)\n\\;+\\;\n\\mu(x,t)\\,\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial x}\n\\Bigr].\n\\]\n\nThus, the PDE becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p(x, t)}{\\partial t}\n\\,=\\,\n-\\frac{\\partial \\mu(x,t)}{\\partial x}\\,p(x,t)\n\\;-\\;\n\\mu(x,t)\\,\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial x}.\n\\]\n\nWe can label these two contributions:\n\n1. **\\(-\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial x} \\, p(x,t)\\)**  \n2. **\\(-\\mu(x,t)\\,\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\)**  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Interpreting the two terms\n\n### 2a. The advection (transport) term\n\\[\n-\\,\\mu(x,t)\\,\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial x}.\n\\]\n\n- This term describes how the probability mass \\(p(x,t)\\) is *transported* along the \\(x\\)-axis by the \u201cvelocity\u201d \\(\\mu(x,t)\\).  \n- If \\(\\mu(x,t)\\) is positive, it \u201cpushes\u201d the probability density to the right; if \\(\\mu\\) is negative, it pushes it to the left.  \n- This is analogous to advection/transport in fluid dynamics, where \\(\\mu(x,t)\\) plays the role of a flow velocity.\n\n### 2b. The growth/decay (\u201csource/sink\u201d) term\n\\[\n-\\,\\frac{\\partial \\mu(x,t)}{\\partial x}\\,p(x,t).\n\\]\n\n- This term modifies \\(p(x,t)\\) *locally* depending on whether \\(\\mu(x,t)\\) is expanding or contracting the density in that region.  \n- If \\(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial x} > 0\\) (flow is *increasing* with \\(x\\)), it creates a local decay in \\(p\\); if \\(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial x} < 0\\) (flow is *decreasing* with \\(x\\)), it creates local growth. Intuitively:  \n  - A region of *divergent flow* (\\(\\partial \\mu/\\partial x > 0\\)) tends to \u201cthin out\u201d the probability, hence it decreases.  \n  - A region of *convergent flow* (\\(\\partial \\mu/\\partial x < 0\\)) accumulates probability mass, hence \\(p\\) increases.  \n\nPut differently, \\(-(\\partial_x \\mu)p\\) is a \u201csource/sink\u201d term in the probability continuity equation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How different classes of \\(\\mu(x,t)\\) affect the terms\n\n1. **Constant drift, \\(\\mu(x,t) = v\\).**  \n   - Here \\(\\partial_x \\mu = 0\\).  \n   - The evolution is purely advection:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n     = -\\,v \\,\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x},\n     \\]\n     which simply *shifts* \\(p(x,t)\\) at velocity \\(v\\).  \n   - No source/sink term appears because the flow is uniform (no compression or expansion).\n\n2. **Spatially varying drift, \\(\\mu = \\mu(x)\\).**  \n   - Now \\(\\partial_x \\mu(x)\\neq 0\\).  \n   - We get both an advection term \\(-\\mu\\,\\partial_x p\\) and a growth/decay term \\(-(\\partial_x \\mu)\\,p\\).  \n   - For example, if \\(\\mu(x)\\) is increasing in \\(x\\), \\(\\partial_x \\mu(x) > 0\\); probability \u201cfans out\u201d in that region, *decreasing* \\(p\\).  \n   - Conversely, if \\(\\mu(x)\\) is decreasing in \\(x\\), \\(\\partial_x \\mu(x) < 0\\); the drift *converges*, *increasing* \\(p\\).\n\n3. **Time-dependent drift, \\(\\mu(x,t)\\).**  \n   - When \\(\\mu\\) depends on time explicitly, both the transport behavior and the local expansion/compression can vary over time.  \n   - One can imagine \u201cturning on\u201d or \u201cturning off\u201d certain flow features as \\(t\\) changes. This might create complex temporal behavior in \\(p\\).  \n\n4. **Divergence-free vs. non-divergence-free flows.**  \n   - In multiple dimensions, writing \\(\\nabla \\cdot [\\mu\\,p]\\) shows a direct connection to whether \\(\\nabla\\cdot \\mu\\) is zero or not.  \n   - If \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mu = 0\\), then there is no net local compression/expansion from the drift, and the dynamics are \u201cvolume preserving.\u201d In probability language, that means no local source/sink from \\(\\mu\\).  \n   - If \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mu \\neq 0\\), then some regions compress or expand the PDF.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The **advection/transport** term \\(-\\,\\mu(x,t)\\,\\partial_x p\\) captures how probability mass is pushed around by \\(\\mu\\).  \n- The **growth/decay** (or source/sink) term \\(-\\,(\\partial_x \\mu)\\,p\\) captures how *non-uniform* drift fields cause local increases or decreases in the PDF.  \n\nDifferent forms of \\(\\mu(x,t)\\) alter these two terms in different ways:\n- **Constant** \\(\\mu\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) pure shift (no growth/decay).  \n- **Spatially varying** \\(\\mu(x)\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) both advection and local growth/decay.  \n- **Time-dependent** \\(\\mu(x,t)\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) advection plus time-varying local expansion/contraction."

              "Below is an intuitive discussion of how \u201cattractors\u201d arise and can be classified when looking at the Fokker\u2013Planck (or continuity-type) equation purely in its deterministic (drift-only) form. We will focus on the 1D setting for concreteness, but the ideas extend to higher dimensions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck (Continuity) Equation\n\nWe consider\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t}\n\\;=\\;\n-\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigl[\\mu(x,t)\\,p(x,t)\\bigr],\n\\]\nwith no diffusion term. This is essentially a **continuity equation** describing how the probability density \\(p(x,t)\\) is transported by the velocity (drift) \\(\\mu(x,t)\\). \n\n### Steady states vs. attractors\n\n- A **steady-state solution** \\(p^*(x)\\) to this PDE is one for which \\(\\partial_t p^*(x) = 0\\).  \n- An **attractor** informally means that if we start with \u201cnearby\u201d initial distributions \\(p(x,0)\\), their evolution under the PDE tends to that same steady state (or set) over time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Relationship to the Underlying ODE \\(\\dot{x} = \\mu(x,t)\\)\n\nIf you imagine a single particle moving deterministically according to \\(\\dot{x} = \\mu(x,t)\\), an **attractor** in the usual dynamical-systems sense is a set in state space (e.g., a stable equilibrium point, stable limit cycle, etc.) to which trajectories converge.\n\nFrom the PDE viewpoint (the distribution of many such particles):\n\n- The PDE \u201cadvects\u201d probability mass along solutions of \\(\\dot{x} = \\mu(x,t)\\).  \n- In the long run, probability concentrates (or \u201ccollapses\u201d) onto the stable attractors of that ODE flow\u2014wherever individual trajectories would accumulate.\n\nHence the **same** sets in \\(x\\)-space that are stable attractors for the ODE become attractors for the distribution \\(p(x,t)\\) (often in the sense of delta-concentrations in the no-diffusion limit).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Classification in 1D (No Diffusion)\n\n### 3.1 Stationary Points \\(\\mu(x^*) = 0\\)\n\nIn 1D, the basic attractors under a deterministic drift are the **stable fixed points** \\(x^*\\) where \\(\\mu(x^*)=0\\) and  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\biggl|_{x=x^*} < 0 \\quad (\\text{negative slope}).\n\\]\n- **Stable**: Particles near \\(x^*\\) get pulled back in, so probability flows into \\(x^*\\).  \n- **Unstable** if the slope is \\(> 0\\). Probability flows away from that point.\n\nFrom the PDE viewpoint:\n- Over time, \\(p(x,t)\\) will tend to concentrate at (or near) the stable equilibrium(s).  \n- Mathematically, in the limit \\(t \\to \\infty\\), \\(p(x,t)\\) often becomes a **sum of delta functions** at the stable fixed points.\n\n#### Example  \n\\[\n\\dot{x} = \\mu(x) = x(1 - x^2).\n\\]\n- Equilibria at \\(x=0\\) (unstable if \\(\\mu'(0)=1>0\\)) and \\(x=\\pm 1\\) (both stable, since \\(\\mu'(\\pm1)=-2<0\\)).  \n- Under the PDE, \\(p(x,t)\\) \u201csplits\u201d and flows to \\(\\delta(x+1)\\) and \\(\\delta(x-1)\\), depending on initial conditions.\n\n### 3.2 Boundaries or Sinks at Infinity\n\nIn unbounded domains, if \\(\\mu(x)\\) tends to \u201cpush\u201d particles off to \\(\\pm\\infty\\), you can get \u201cescape to infinity.\u201d  \n- From the PDE perspective, the probability mass that \u201cescapes\u201d accumulates at the boundary (if one exists) or effectively leaves the domain.  \n\n### 3.3 Time-Dependent Drift \\(\\mu(x,t)\\)\n\nIf \\(\\mu\\) depends explicitly on \\(t\\), the notion of \u201cfixed point\u201d changes to a **time-dependent attractor** or a **moving equilibrium**. In 1D, you can still look at instantaneous equilibria \\(\\mu(x,t) = 0\\), but stability may also vary in time, causing probability to shift accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Classification in Higher Dimensions\n\nAlthough your question is in the 1D context, it\u2019s worth noting that in multiple dimensions:\n\n- **Stable fixed points** (where \\(\\mathbf{\\mu}(\\mathbf{x^*}) = 0\\) and the Jacobian has negative real parts) will draw in probability mass.  \n- **Stable limit cycles** (and more exotic attractors) can exist in 2D or higher, and the PDE solution \\(p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) will concentrate on those sets in the long run (again, in the zero-diffusion limit).  \n- In the language of fluid flows, if \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{\\mu} = 0\\) (incompressible), no net creation or destruction of density occurs\u2014probability is just \u201cstirred.\u201d If \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{\\mu} \\neq 0\\), local expansion or compression occurs as well.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of Attractor Classification in \\(p\\)-Dynamics\n\n1. **Find the attractors of the ODE** \\(\\dot{x} = \\mu(x,t)\\)\u2014these can be:  \n   - **Stable equilibria** (1D or higher).  \n   - **Stable limit cycles** (in higher dimension).  \n   - **More complicated sets** (in truly nonlinear systems).  \n\n2. **In purely deterministic PDEs (no diffusion)**, probability mass flows along the characteristics (the solutions to the ODE).  \n   - **Stable** sets in the ODE attract the probability mass.  \n   - The long-time solution for \\(p(x,t)\\) typically becomes a **delta (or sum of deltas) concentrated** on the stable equilibria/attractors.  \n\n3. **If \\(\\mu\\) is time-dependent**, you get time-varying attractors. Probability still flows toward these stable sets, but the location and stability can change in time.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- In the **distribution (PDE) sense**, an attractor is any set where probability mass asymptotically concentrates under the drift \\(\\mu\\).  \n- **In 1D deterministic systems**, these are usually the **stable fixed points** where \\(\\mu(x^*)=0\\) and \\(\\mu'(x^*)<0\\).  \n- In **higher dimensions**, limit cycles or chaotic sets can also be attractors; the distribution tends to collapse onto those sets in the zero-diffusion limit."

              "Below is a fairly detailed look at how one analyzes the *deterministic (drift-only)* evolution of a probability density \\(p(x,y,t)\\) under the classical two-species Lotka\u2013Volterra model. In other words, we treat the Lotka\u2013Volterra ODE system as giving us a velocity (or \u201cdrift\u201d) field \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\\) in the \\((x,y)\\)-plane and then study the associated continuity (Liouville) equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n\\,=\\,\n-\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\\,p(x,y,t)\\bigr],\n\\]\n\n**without** diffusion. We will see how key features of Lotka\u2013Volterra\u2014its fixed points, closed orbits, and conserved quantities\u2014manifest in the PDE description of how probability flows over the state space.\n\n---\n\n# 1. The Lotka\u2013Volterra System\n\nThe classical 2D Lotka\u2013Volterra (LV) equations for prey (\\(x \\ge 0\\)) and predator (\\(y \\ge 0\\)) are\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x} \\;=\\; x(\\alpha - \\beta\\,y),\\\\[6pt]\n\\dot{y} \\;=\\; -\\,y(\\gamma - \\delta\\,x),\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad\n(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta > 0).\n\\]\n\nEquivalently, define the drift vector field\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\n\\;=\\;\n\\bigl(\\,\\mu_1(x,y),\\,\\mu_2(x,y)\\bigr)\n\\;=\\;\n\\bigl(\\,\nx(\\alpha - \\beta y),\\;\n-\\,y(\\gamma - \\delta x)\n\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nWe assume \\( (x,y)\\) lies in the first quadrant \\(\\{x \\ge 0,\\,y \\ge 0\\}\\).  \n\n## 1.1 Fixed Points and Closed Orbits\n\n1. **Trivial fixed point** at \\((0,0)\\).  \n   - Checking stability in the standard ODE sense shows \\((0,0)\\) is typically a saddle or unstable if \\(\\alpha,\\gamma>0\\).  \n\n2. **Prey-only / Predator-only boundary equilibria.**  \n   - For instance, \\((\\tfrac{\\alpha}{\\beta}, 0)\\) or \\((0, \\tfrac{\\gamma}{\\delta})\\), depending on parameter values.  \n\n3. **Positive interior fixed point** at\n   \\[\n   (x^*,\\,y^*)\n   \\;=\\;\n   \\Bigl(\\,\\tfrac{\\gamma}{\\delta},\\;\\tfrac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\Bigr).\n   \\]\n   - In the *classical* Lotka\u2013Volterra model, this point is a **center**: all nearby trajectories in the interior are closed orbits surrounding it.  \n   - Indeed, LV has a well-known *conserved quantity* (a \u201cfirst integral\u201d), which implies the orbits are closed curves in the interior of the domain.\n\nFrom a purely deterministic ODE viewpoint, no trajectory (with strictly positive initial conditions) settles down to a limit cycle or equilibrium; rather, it orbits indefinitely around \\((x^*,y^*)\\).\n\n---\n\n# 2. The Deterministic Probability-Transport Equation\n\nWe now imagine a *distribution* of many particles (or \u201cmass of probability\u201d) evolving according to the drift \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\\). The probability density \\(p(x,y,t)\\) satisfies\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n\\;=\\;\n-\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\\,p(x,y,t)\\bigr],\n\\quad\n(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2_{\\ge 0}.\n\\]\n\nIn coordinates, this is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n\\;+\\;\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigl[\nx(\\alpha - \\beta\\,y)\\,p\n\\bigr]\n\\;+\\;\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\bigl[\n-\\,y(\\gamma - \\delta\\,x)\\,p\n\\bigr]\n\\;=\\;0.\n\\]\n\nThis is the same as the **continuity equation** (or the Liouville equation, in Hamiltonian-like contexts) for a time-independent flow \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\\).\n\n### 2.1 Characteristics and \u201cNo-Diffusion\u201d Transport\n\nBecause there is *no diffusion* (no Brownian term), \\(p\\) is purely *advected* along the flow lines of \\(\\dot{x}=\\mu_1,\\;\\dot{y}=\\mu_2\\). In PDE language, the solution \\(p(\\cdot,t)\\) at any time \\(t\\) is just the **push-forward** of the initial distribution \\(p_0(x,y) = p(x,y,0)\\) by the flow \\(\\Phi^t\\) generated by \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\). Concretely:\n\n- If a \u201cfluid parcel\u201d of probability starts at \\((x_0,y_0)\\) at \\(t=0\\), then at time \\(t\\) it sits at \\(\\Phi^t(x_0,y_0)\\).  \n- The density at \\((x_0,y_0)\\) at time 0 ends up (without smearing) along that characteristic path.  \n\nHence if you track each point in the support of \\(p_0\\), it just moves around along the Lotka\u2013Volterra ODE trajectories.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Impact of the Lotka\u2013Volterra Orbits on \\(p(x,y,t)\\)\n\n## 3.1 Closed Orbits in the Interior\n\nFor the *classical* choice of parameters, inside the positive quadrant, all orbits (except possibly those colliding with axes) are closed loops around the interior fixed point \\((x^*, y^*)\\). From the PDE perspective, this means:\n\n1. **No global attractor** in the usual sense.  \n   - Because the deterministic LV system is *conservative-like* (or Hamiltonian-like) around \\((x^*,y^*)\\), there is no stable spiral or limit cycle that pulls all trajectories inward. Instead, each trajectory stays on its own closed loop of constant \u201cenergy.\u201d  \n   - Consequently, the probability distribution \\(p(x,y,t)\\) does not converge to a single steady state.  \n\n2. **Probability parcels revolve around** the center.  \n   - If you pick an initial region of probability in the interior (with \\(x,y>0\\)), those parcels revolve around \\((x^*,y^*)\\), returning (modulo phase) to their starting shapes at times that match the orbital periods.  \n\nMathematically, because solutions to the PDE are constant along characteristic curves (when there is no diffusion), one finds that\n\\[\np\\bigl(\\Phi^t(x_0,y_0),\\,t\\bigr)\n\\;=\\;\np_0(x_0,y_0)\n\\quad\n\\text{(assuming no crossing of boundaries).}\n\\]\nBut \\(\\Phi^t(x_0,y_0)\\) is just the *closed orbit* passing through \\((x_0,y_0)\\).\n\n### 3.1.1 Conserved Quantity and Level Sets\n\nA standard fact: Classical LV has an integral of motion (a function \\(H(x,y)\\) that is constant along orbits).  A common form is\n\\[\nH(x,y)\n\\;=\\;\n\\alpha\\,\\ln x - \\beta\\,x\n\\;+\\;\n\\gamma\\,\\ln y - \\delta\\,y,\n\\]\nup to additive constants.  Each closed orbit in the interior is a level curve \\(H(x,y)=\\text{const}\\).  \n\nThen from the PDE viewpoint, since \\(p\\) is constant along these orbits, \\(p\\) is effectively \u201cconstant along the level sets of \\(H\\).\u201d Hence\n\\[\np\\bigl(x(t),\\,y(t),\\,t\\bigr)\n\\;=\\; \np_0\\bigl(x(0),\\,y(0)\\bigr)\n\\]\nwhenever \\(\\{\\,x(t),\\,y(t)\\}\\) is the solution of the ODE starting at \\((x(0),y(0))\\).\n\n## 3.2 Boundary Behavior\n\nIf initial conditions place some probability mass on or near the boundaries, the flow can drive that mass in or out.  For example:\n\n- **\\(x=0\\) axis**:  The ODE reduces to \\(\\dot{x}=0,\\;\\dot{y}=-\\gamma y\\).  So any mass exactly on \\(x=0\\) (with \\(y>0\\)) will flow down to \\((0,0)\\) as \\(t \\to \\infty\\).  \n- **\\(y=0\\) axis**:  The ODE reduces to \\(\\dot{x}=\\alpha x,\\;\\dot{y}=0\\).  So mass on \\(y=0\\) flows outward in the \\(x\\)-direction, or possibly to \\((0,0)\\) if \\(x\\) was zero to begin with.\n\nHence boundaries can act as partial sinks or sources, depending on parameters and initial conditions.  In many classic parameter regimes, \\((0,0)\\) is a \u201csaddle\u201d and not a strongly attracting corner, but the boundary flows can still gather mass to corners if the initial measure has support there.\n\n---\n\n# 4. Stationary Solutions vs. Time-Dependent Solutions\n\nA **stationary solution** \\(p^*(x,y)\\) would satisfy\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\\,p^*(x,y)\\bigr]\n\\;=\\;0.\n\\]\nIn principle, one can look for nontrivial solutions in the positive quadrant.  However, for the classical LV flow:\n\n- Because each interior trajectory is a closed loop, one nontrivial possibility is: \n  \\[\n  p^*(x,y)\\;\\equiv\\;0\n  \\quad\\text{(the trivial zero solution, ignoring normalization)},\n  \\]\n  which is not a valid probability density.  \n- Another possibility is a \u201cmixture\u201d of delta masses on boundary equilibria or on a closed orbit, etc. But those typically come from limits of advection plus *some dissipative effect* or boundary absorption.  \n\nIn a purely *conservative* (Hamiltonian-like) 2D flow with closed orbits, a smooth positive stationary solution in the interior usually would require \\(\\nabla \\cdot ( \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\,p^*) = 0\\).  But since \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\neq 0\\) in general for LV, that is a nontrivial PDE condition and often only the trivial solution emerges (or distributions supported on special sets).  \n\nHence the standard Lotka\u2013Volterra system, *without diffusion*, typically does *not* possess a unique positive stationary density across the interior.  The solution \\(p(x,y,t)\\) genuinely retains time dependence as mass travels around closed orbits.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Divergence of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) and (Non-)Volume Preservation\n\nIt can be illuminating to compute\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\n\\;=\\;\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\n\\bigl[x(\\alpha - \\beta\\,y)\\bigr]\n\\;+\\;\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n\\bigl[-\\,y(\\gamma - \\delta\\,x)\\bigr].\n\\]\nA quick check:\n- \\(\\partial/\\partial x \\,[x(\\alpha - \\beta y)] = \\alpha - \\beta\\,y\\),  \n- \\(\\partial/\\partial y \\,[-\\,y(\\gamma - \\delta x)] = -(\\gamma - \\delta x).\\)\n\nThus\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\n\\;=\\;\n(\\alpha - \\beta\\,y)\\;-\\;(\\gamma - \\delta\\,x)\n\\;=\\;\n(\\alpha - \\gamma)\\;+\\;\\delta\\,x \\;-\\;\\beta\\,y.\n\\]\nUnless parameters match in a special way (e.g. \\(\\alpha=\\gamma\\) and \\(\\beta=\\delta\\)), this is not identically zero, so the flow is *not* area-preserving.  That in turn implies that if you follow a small region of probability in the \\((x,y)\\)-plane, it may locally expand or contract depending on the sign of \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\).  \n\nFrom the PDE perspective, that expansion or contraction corresponds to having a *source/sink term*\n\\[\n-\\,(\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\mu})\\,p\n\\]\nin the expanded form of the continuity equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n\\;=\\;\n-\\;\\bigl(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\bigr)\\,p\n\\;-\\;\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\cdot\\nabla p.\n\\]\n\n- The term \\(-\\,\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\cdot\\nabla p\\) is the \u201cpure transport\u201d (advection).  \n- The term \\(-\\,(\\nabla\\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu})\\,p\\) is the \u201clocal growth/decay\u201d due to divergence or convergence of the flow.\n\n---\n\n# 6. Summary & Key Takeaways\n\n1. **The PDE**:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n   \\;=\\;\n   -\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\bigl[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\\,p\\bigr],\n   \\quad\n   \\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)=\\bigl(x(\\alpha-\\beta y),\\,-y(\\gamma-\\delta x)\\bigr).\n   \\]\n\n2. **Characteristics & Closed Orbits**:  \n   - Because there is no diffusion, \\(p\\) is *constant along characteristic trajectories* of the ODE system.  \n   - The classical LV model has *closed orbits* in the positive quadrant, around the interior fixed point.  \n   - Thus, if initial conditions lie wholly in the interior, the probability distribution *rotates* around that center forever, typically without converging to a single steady state.\n\n3. **Conserved Quantity**:  \n   - A function \\(H(x,y)\\) remains constant along each orbit, so the PDE solution at time \\(t\\) is essentially the initial condition \u201creshuffled\u201d around these invariant loops.\n\n4. **Boundary Effects**:  \n   - Portions of the distribution on the boundaries can flow toward (0,0) or away along axes, potentially accumulating mass in boundary equilibria\u2014depending on parameter values and initial support.\n\n5. **No Unique Positive Stationary Density**:  \n   - The classical LV flow is not dissipative in the interior, so there is *no single attractor* that would concentrate all probability.  \n   - In fact, one typically gets *ongoing oscillations* in the distribution \\(p(x,y,t)\\) unless it degenerates onto boundary equilibria.\n\n6. **Divergence \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\)**:  \n   - In general, \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\neq 0\\) for Lotka\u2013Volterra, so the flow is not volume-preserving.  \n   - Locally, mass can be compressed or expanded, leading to a source/sink term \\(-(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\mu})\\,p\\) in the PDE.\n\n### In Short\n\n- *Mathematically*, the no-diffusion Fokker\u2013Planck/continuity equation for Lotka\u2013Volterra is solved by \u201cadvecting\u201d the initial density along the closed orbits (and boundary flows).  \n- *Dynamically*, the distribution generally does *not* settle to a single stationary shape in the interior because the system is neutral (no damping) around the center equilibrium.  \n- *Physically*, one can interpret the swirling of probability around \\((x^*,y^*)\\) as perpetual predator\u2013prey oscillations in the population distribution\u2014no damping, no random diffusion smoothing them out.\n\nThis completes the main in-depth analysis of how the Lotka\u2013Volterra ODE flow shapes the evolution of a probability density \\(p(x,y,t)\\) in state space *when only deterministic advection (drift) is present and no diffusion terms are included.*"

Thus:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\,H\\bigl(x(t),y(t)\\bigr)\n   = 0,\n   \\]\n   meaning \\(H(x,y)\\) is **constant** along solutions.\n\n> **Important Note**: The expression for \\(H\\) can vary by additive constants or by rearranging coefficients. What matters is that **any** function \\(H(x,y)\\) whose total time derivative along solutions is zero is a constant of motion.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Consequence: Closed Orbits are Level Sets of \\(H\\)\n\nIn the interior \\((x>0,\\,y>0)\\), the classical Lotka\u2013Volterra flow is neither attracting nor repelling but rather \u201cneutral.\u201d The orbits are exactly the curves \\(H(x,y)=\\mathrm{const}\\). Each initial condition \\(\\bigl(x(0),y(0)\\bigr)\\) has its own value of \\(H\\)\u2014call it \\(C\\). The trajectory stays forever on the level set \\(\\{(x,y): H(x,y)=C\\}\\), which is a **closed loop** around the equilibrium point \\(\\bigl(x^*,y^*\\bigr)\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary\n\n- **Conserved Quantity**:  \n  \\[\n  H(x,y)\n  \\;=\\;\n  \\alpha\\,\\ln x - \\beta\\,x\n  \\;+\\;\n  \\gamma\\,\\ln y - \\delta\\,y.\n  \\]\n- **How to Find It**:  \n  1. Guess (or systematically search for) a combination of \\(x, \\ln x, y, \\ln y\\) whose time derivative vanishes using the ODEs.  \n  2. Verify by direct differentiation that \\(\\frac{d}{dt}H=0\\).  \n- **Interpretation**:  \n  - The level curves \\(H(x,y)=\\mathrm{const}\\) are the closed orbits in the positive quadrant.  \n  - Thus, every **Lotka\u2013Volterra trajectory** in \\(\\{x>0,y>0\\}\\) stays on its own loop for all time."

              "Below is a concise explanation of why the classical Lotka\u2013Volterra (LV) predator\u2013prey system is **not** strictly Hamiltonian in the standard sense, even though it admits a conserved quantity and closed orbits. In short, it is often described as a **conservative** or **non-dissipative** system but **not** Hamiltonian (with the usual symplectic structure).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Recap of the LV System and Its Integral\n\nThe two-dimensional Lotka\u2013Volterra model\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x} \\;=\\; x(\\alpha - \\beta\\,y),\\\\[3pt]\n\\dot{y} \\;=\\; -\\,y(\\gamma - \\delta\\,x),\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nadmits a first integral (conserved quantity) typically written as \n\\[\nH(x,y)\n\\;=\\;\n\\alpha \\,\\ln x - \\beta\\,x\n\\;+\\;\n\\gamma \\,\\ln y - \\delta\\,y,\n\\]\nwith \\(\\frac{d}{dt}H\\bigl(x(t),y(t)\\bigr)=0\\) on each trajectory in the positive quadrant.  Consequently, one gets **closed orbits** in the interior (each orbit is a level curve \\(H(x,y) = \\text{constant}\\)), so the flow is **conservative** (no net dissipation).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hamiltonian vs. \u201cJust\u201d Conservative\n\n- A **Hamiltonian system** in two dimensions (with coordinates \\((q,p)\\), say) typically satisfies\n  \\[\n  \\dot{q} \\;=\\;\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial p}, \n  \\quad\n  \\dot{p} \\;=\\;-\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial q},\n  \\]\n  under the **standard symplectic structure** \\(\\omega = dq \\wedge dp\\).  \n\n- A system is called **conservative** or **non-dissipative** if it has at least one conserved quantity (often called a \u201cfirst integral\u201d) that remains constant along trajectories. \n\n### 2.1 Why LV Is Not Canonically Hamiltonian\n\nIf you try to interpret \\((x,y)\\) as \\((q,p)\\) and see if the LV equations\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x} = x(\\alpha - \\beta\\,y),\\\\\n\\dot{y} = -\\,y(\\gamma - \\delta\\,x)\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\ncan come from a Hamiltonian \\(\\mathcal{H}(x,y)\\) such that\n\\[\n\\dot{x} \\;=\\;\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial y}, \n\\quad\n\\dot{y} \\;=\\;-\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}}{\\partial x},\n\\]\nyou run into mismatches:\n\n1. **Signs / factor structures**:  A canonical Hamiltonian system in 2D typically couples the partial derivatives in a \u201ccrossed\u201d manner (\\(\\dot{x}\\) couples to \\(\\partial \\mathcal{H}/\\partial y\\); \\(\\dot{y}\\) couples to \\(-\\,\\partial \\mathcal{H}/\\partial x\\)).  In contrast, the LV right-hand sides mix \\(x\\,(\\dots)\\) and \\(y\\,(\\dots)\\) in a way that does not match the usual symplectic pattern.\n\n2. **Divergence**:  For a Hamiltonian system in the plane \\((q,p)\\), one has\n   \\(\\nabla \\cdot (\\dot{q}, \\dot{p}) = 0\\); it is an **area-preserving** flow.  \n   - Indeed, \\(\\nabla\\cdot(\\partial_{y} \\mathcal{H},\\,-\\partial_{x} \\mathcal{H})=0\\).  \n   - For Lotka\u2013Volterra, the divergence of the drift field \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(x,y)\\) is generally \\(\\alpha - \\beta\\,y \\;-\\;(\\gamma - \\delta x)\\neq 0\\), so LV is **not** area-preserving unless the parameters happen to satisfy special relationships.  \n\nHence, although the system has a first integral and exhibits closed orbits, it does **not** obey the standard Hamiltonian mechanics formulation with the usual symplectic structure. It is therefore **not** a Hamiltonian system in the strict (canonical) sense.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final Word\n\n- **Lotka\u2013Volterra** is:\n  - **Conservative** (or non-dissipative): it has a first integral \\(H\\) and trajectories do not converge to a point or limit cycle in the interior.  \n  - **Not** standard Hamiltonian: it does not arise from \\(\\dot{x}=\\partial H/\\partial y,\\,\\dot{y}=-\\partial H/\\partial x\\) under the usual symplectic form, nor does it preserve area in general.\n\nThus, one often refers to the classical 2D Lotka\u2013Volterra equations as an example of a **conservative system with a constant of motion** but **not** a Hamiltonian system in the canonical sense."

              "Below is an **intuitive** way to distinguish a **Hamiltonian system** from a more general **conservative** system. Both share the idea that \u201csomething is conserved,\u201d but Hamiltonian systems carry an extra geometric structure that changes the nature of their flow in phase space.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Both Have Something That Doesn\u2019t Decay\n\n- In **any** conservative system (in the broad sense), there is at least one quantity\u2014call it \\(I\\)\u2014that remains constant along trajectories. In predator\u2013prey models like Lotka\u2013Volterra, \\(I\\) might be a special combination of \\(\\ln x,\\,x,\\,\\ln y,\\) etc., which never changes as the system evolves.  \n- Intuitively, this \u201clocks\u201d you onto a particular curve or surface in state space, so you cannot flow off into some other region. You might circle around, or orbit on that surface forever, but you won\u2019t converge to a fixed point (dissipation) or spiral outward (explosive growth).\n\nSo at a gut level, **conservative** means \u201cthe system\u2019s motion is restricted to surfaces of constant \\(I\\).\u201d No friction or damping is removing or adding that quantity over time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hamiltonian Systems Have a \u201cSymplectic\u201d Flow\n\n- **Hamiltonian** systems (in the physics sense) impose a stronger requirement: the flow must come from \u201cHamilton\u2019s equations\u201d \n  \\[\n    \\dot{q} \\;=\\;\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p},\\quad\n    \\dot{p} \\;=\\;-\\,\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q},\n  \\]\n  and it **preserves volume** in phase space (this is sometimes called being an \u201cincompressible flow\u201d in phase space).  \n- Imagine you have a little blob of initial conditions in \\((q,p)\\)-space. In a Hamiltonian system, as time goes on, that blob might get sheared or stretched, but it never changes its total area (in 2D) or volume (in higher dimensions).  \n\nBy contrast, a **generic conservative** system might still keep some energy- or integral-like quantity constant, but **it can stretch or squeeze** the volume in state space because it\u2019s not constrained by the full Hamiltonian (symplectic) structure. This is why, for instance, the Lotka\u2013Volterra flow (though it has closed orbits and a conserved function) usually doesn\u2019t preserve areas in \\((x,y)\\)-space.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Feeling It in Your Bones\n\n- In a purely **Hamiltonian** world, you can think of \u201cphase-space fluid\u201d that **never gets denser or thinner**\u2014it only sloshes around without friction. Every point in that fluid moves according to Hamilton\u2019s equations, so **both** a function \\(H(q,p)\\) is conserved (the \u201cenergy\u201d), **and** the fluid volume in phase space stays exactly the same.  \n- In a more **general conservative** world, you only know there\u2019s some quantity that doesn\u2019t change per trajectory\u2014but that \u201cphase-space fluid\u201d can still bunch up or spread out in certain regions. There\u2019s no guarantee of perfect \u201cincompressibility.\u201d  \n\nHence, **all Hamiltonian systems are conservative,** but not all conservative systems are Hamiltonian. The special ingredient that makes a system \u201cHamiltonian in your bones\u201d is that the motion has the feel of a \u201cfrictionless, incompressible slosh\u201d in phase space, governed by a single Hamiltonian function, rather than just any old rule that keeps one integral of motion constant."

              "Below is a concise explanation of why the **classical two-dimensional Lotka\u2013Volterra (LV) predator\u2013prey system** is **not** considered chaotic\u2014at least not in its standard, autonomous form.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Classical 2D Lotka\u2013Volterra Model\n\nThe usual LV model is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x} \\;=\\; x(\\alpha - \\beta\\,y),\\\\[3pt]\n\\dot{y} \\;=\\; -\\,y(\\gamma - \\delta\\,x),\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad\n(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta>0).\n\\]\n\n- In the **interior** \\((x>0,\\,y>0)\\), it has a conserved quantity (first integral), often written\n  \\[\n  H(x,y) \n  \\;=\\; \\alpha \\ln x \\;-\\;\\beta x \n   \\;+\\; \\gamma \\ln y \\;-\\;\\delta y,\n  \\]\n  which remains constant along trajectories.  \n- As a result, **each trajectory** in the positive quadrant follows a **closed orbit** around the equilibrium \\(\\bigl(\\tfrac{\\gamma}{\\delta},\\,\\tfrac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\bigr)\\).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Why It\u2019s Not Chaotic\n\n### 2.1 No Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions\n\nA hallmark of **chaotic** systems is **sensitive dependence on initial conditions**: arbitrarily close initial states can diverge and lead to vastly different long-term outcomes. In the standard 2D LV:\n\n- If two initial conditions lie on two slightly different level sets of \\(H\\), they remain on **separate, closed orbits** forever.  \n- Each orbit is isolated by its own constant of motion \\(H(x,y) = \\text{const}\\).  \n- There is **no mechanism** for orbits to \u201cunfold\u201d onto one another or diverge exponentially; instead, they keep looping around at a (generally) constant amplitude.\n\nHence there is **no exponential sensitivity** in the 2D LV phase space.\n\n### 2.2 It\u2019s an Integrable, 2D System\n\nThe classical 2D predator\u2013prey LV model is essentially an **integrable system**: it has as many independent first integrals (one in 2D) as dimensions, so solutions remain confined to the level sets of that integral. Integrable systems in two dimensions almost always produce (when bounded) **closed orbits** or periodic solutions\u2014not chaotic attractors.\n\nBy contrast, **chaos** in continuous-time dynamical systems typically requires at least three dimensions (or some time-dependent forcing in 2D) to allow for tangled trajectories, strange attractors, or complicated phase-space structures.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Can Lotka\u2013Volterra Become Chaotic?\n\n- **In 2D, standard form**: No. The system is neutral or conservative-like and does not exhibit chaos.  \n- **With additional terms or higher dimensions**: Possibly. If one modifies the LV equations (e.g., adding logistic growth terms, delays, density-dependent effects, or moves to 3D or higher), one can sometimes get complex or chaotic dynamics.  \n- **Time-varying forcing**: A 2D system with a suitable periodic or non-periodic forcing can also display chaotic behavior, even if the unforced system is not chaotic.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bottom Line\n\n- The **classical two-dimensional** Lotka\u2013Volterra predator\u2013prey system has a **conserved quantity** and orbits that are **closed loops**\u2014there is **no sensitive dependence on initial conditions** and no strange attractors.  \n- Hence it is **not chaotic** in its standard autonomous form. Any \u201coscillations\u201d you see are purely **periodic** (or neutrally stable) rather than chaotic."
