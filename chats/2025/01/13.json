              "I'm simulating the rossler system. I have a one simulation which runs 100M gaussian distributed starting conditions in parallel and plots the hist. That produces an interesting filamentous shape. However, when I simulate a 3D gaussian evolving according to the determinstic fokker-planck equation:\n\n\\partial_t \\rho = -\\nabla \\cdot [f \\rho] = -(\\nabla \\cdot f) \\rho - f \\cdot \\nabla \\rho\n\nWhere f is the function that returns dx, dy, dz. The result is still a smooth structure without these fine filaments. What's wrong with my simulation? Is the math wrong? Am I using the fokker-planck equation incorrectly (I'm confident the determinstic part is a correct assumption, i.e. 0 diffusion). Or should I investigate my simulation? I'm running the simulation over a range of [(-30,30), (-30, 30), (0,25)] with a gaussian initial condition. the resolution is 800x800x800, with dt = 0.00001. "

              "First off, the **deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck equation** (with zero diffusion) you wrote down,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; - \\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[f(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\bigr],\n\\]\n\nis indeed the correct continuum description for advection of a density \\(\\rho\\) by a velocity field \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\). In principle, this PDE *can* capture the same filamentation you see in a direct simulation of \\(10^8\\) particle trajectories\u2014provided the PDE is solved *very* accurately and with *very* fine resolution. \n\nHowever, in practice, there are several numerical \u201cgotchas\u201d that typically cause \\(\\rho\\) to become *artificially smooth* (losing fine filaments) when you solve the PDE on a fixed grid:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Chaotic systems produce *extremely* fine filaments\n\nSystems like the R\u00f6ssler or Lorenz attractors have exponential divergence of trajectories in certain directions. In phase space, this exponential stretching\u2014and folding\u2014quickly drives the density into tiny fractal-like filaments, far below your finite grid size.  \n\n- In your particle-based simulation, even though you start with \\(10^8\\) points, *locally* you might only have a handful of points in any given patch of phase space. You can still visually see narrow \u201ctendrils\u201d in a scatter plot or a histogram because discrete points bunch into folds of the flow.  \n- In the continuum PDE approach, once those filaments are below the grid size, you can\u2019t resolve them. The solver effectively \u201csmears\u201d them out over the size of a single cell, yielding a smooth density \\(\\rho\\). To see filamentation in a PDE context, you\u2019d have to refine your grid to the point that the filaments are well-resolved.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Numerical schemes introduce *artificial diffusion*\n\nAny standard finite-volume, finite-difference, or finite-element solver for an advection equation,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot (f\\,\\rho),\n\\]\n\nwill typically have some *artificial numerical diffusion*. Even small amounts of numerical diffusion will smooth out steep gradients (where filaments form). This artificial diffusion is inherent in many off-the-shelf schemes, e.g.\n\n1. **Upwind schemes** (first- or second-order)  \n2. **Flux-limited or TVD schemes**  \n3. **Low-order in time** methods with explicit time stepping  \n\nEven if the PDE is purely hyperbolic (and \u201cideal\u201d hyperbolic solvers exist), in practice any grid-based solver has to prevent the formation of spurious oscillations (Gibbs phenomena). The usual fix is adding enough diffusion (or slope limiting) to keep the solution stable. \n\nThis is not necessarily \u201cwrong,\u201d but it *does* wash out very fine filaments. The more chaotic the flow, the faster it drives \\(\\rho\\) into small-scale structures, and the more conspicuous the smoothing becomes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Time-step size, resolution, and domain extent\n\nYou mention:\n\n- Resolution: \\(800 \\times 800 \\times 800\\).  \n- Time step: \\(\\Delta t = 10^{-5}\\).  \n- Domain: \\([x,y,z] \\in [-30,30]\\times[-30,30]\\times[0,25]\\).  \n\nEven though \\(800^3\\) might sound large, for a strongly chaotic 3D flow, this might *still* be too coarse. You\u2019re trying to represent rapidly developing filaments on a fixed grid; they can easily get thinner than one grid cell in short times. Moreover:\n\n- If \\(\\Delta t\\) is too large for the chosen spatial discretization (i.e., CFL condition is near borderline), you can accumulate extra numerical diffusion.  \n- If the domain is large, the chaotic attractor might only occupy a fraction of your grid, meaning effectively you have even fewer cells *in* the region of interest\u2014again leading to more smoothing.\n\n---\n\n### 4. How can you see filaments in the PDE solution?\n\nIf your goal is truly to capture the filaments in a PDE-based approach, you typically need:\n\n1. **High-order advection scheme** with minimized numerical diffusion.  \n2. **Adaptive mesh refinement** (AMR) to add resolution precisely where the flow develops fine filaments.  \n3. **Lagrangian methods** (e.g., method of characteristics or particle-in-cell) that track the PDE solution in phase space more directly.  \n\nMany researchers who study chaotic advection in continuous media either (1) run *very* specialized advection solvers or (2) revert to particle-based methods to show the fractal structures. A low- to medium-order finite-difference PDE solver on a uniform grid virtually always appears \u201csmooth\u201d for chaotic flows.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n1. **Nothing is \u201cwrong\u201d with the PDE itself**\u2014the *deterministic* Fokker\u2013Planck (with zero diffusion) is the correct continuum equation.  \n2. **Yes, investigate your simulation**\u2014the smoothing is almost certainly due to **numerical diffusion** and **insufficient grid resolution** to resolve chaotic filaments.  \n3. **In chaotic systems**, filaments rapidly become too fine for a fixed mesh, so the PDE solution on a uniform grid will appear smooth.  \n\nIn other words, your large \\(\\mathrm{N}\\) direct simulation is capturing the fractal/tendrils in a *particle sense*, whereas your grid-based PDE solver is inevitably \u201caveraging out\u201d subgrid scales. If you want to truly resolve those structures in a PDE framework, you would need an extremely high-resolution or AMR-based method with minimal numerical diffusion."

              "First, let\u2019s clarify what \u201csimulate a chaotic system on a computer with finite precision\u201d really means:\n\n1. **Chaotic dynamics** have *extreme sensitivity to initial conditions*. That is, two trajectories starting from *very close* initial states can diverge exponentially quickly in time.  \n\n2. **Finite precision** (floating-point arithmetic) means that small roundoff errors\u2014initial-condition rounding, truncation in each timestep\u2014inevitably creep in. Over time, those tiny errors can be amplified by the chaotic flow, causing the computed trajectory to deviate significantly from the \u201ctrue\u201d mathematical trajectory.\n\nBecause of this exponential divergence, there is a sense in which we cannot reliably track the *exact* trajectory of a chaotic system forever using a finite-precision computer. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cit is impossible to simulate\u201d chaotic systems in any useful sense:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Short-time accuracy is possible\n\nEven though chaotic flows diverge *exponentially*, there is usually a finite time window over which the numerical solution stays close to the exact mathematical solution. This window might be extremely short if the Lyapunov exponents (the rates of divergence) are large, or it may be longer if the flow is only *weakly* chaotic.  \n\nIn practice, for many engineering and scientific applications, just accurately tracking the flow *for some finite time* is the goal\u2014and that can be done successfully on a computer.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Shadowing and \u201cnearby\u201d true trajectories\n\nThere\u2019s a famous result in dynamical systems theory called the **Shadowing Theorem**: in certain hyperbolic (chaotic) systems, even though floating-point errors cause your computed trajectory to deviate from the exact mathematical solution, there often exists a *nearby* exact trajectory of the system that stays close to your computed one over long times.  \n\nThat is, while you might not be following the *exact* solution you started with, your computed solution can still be \u201cshadowed\u201d by some \u201ctrue\u201d solution. In chaotic systems, \u201cthe\u201d trajectory you end up with might differ from the one you intended, but from a qualitative or statistical standpoint, you may still be capturing the same global behavior (the same strange attractor, the same measure, the same Lyapunov exponents, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Statistical properties vs. trajectory-by-trajectory accuracy\n\nIn many chaotic systems (e.g., turbulent fluid flows, climate models), the precise *pointwise trajectory* is not as important as the *statistical or ergodic properties* of the flow\u2014such as average energy, attractor dimension, or other invariant measures.  \n\nIf your interest is the *distribution* of states rather than the exact path of one particular solution, finite-precision errors matter less. Chaotic systems often have robust statistical properties that can be computed even though the exact trajectory wanders unpredictably.\n\n---\n\n### 4. So is it \u201cimpossible\u201d to simulate?\n\n- **Impossible to get the exact trajectory forever?** Strictly speaking, yes\u2014eventually roundoff and model errors will make your numerical solution diverge from the original exact solution you intended to follow.  \n- **Impossible to get meaningful simulations?** Absolutely not. We routinely simulate chaotic systems (like weather, turbulence, etc.) and glean powerful insights, provided we understand the time limits of trajectory accuracy and focus on ensemble or statistical metrics if needed.\n\nThus, while you *cannot* track a chaotic system\u2019s *exact* trajectory on a computer indefinitely, you *can* simulate and study its short-time behavior, and you can still capture its *long-time statistical* properties if that\u2019s your goal. The key is recognizing that chaos fundamentally limits long-term predictive power on a trajectory-by-trajectory basis when only finite-precision arithmetic is available."

Each \u201cpoint\u201d in the ensemble is just a single realization (initial condition), and \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) is the density of those points in phase space at time \\(t\\).  \n\nIn principle, this approach captures *all possible trajectories* in one PDE. However, there are good reasons that you almost never see large-scale PDE-based simulations of chaotic flows in high-dimensional phase space:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Curse of dimensionality\n\nEven for a modestly sized system (say 3D or 4D in phase space), solving the Liouville/Fokker\u2013Planck PDE on a **uniform grid** is extremely computationally expensive\u2014memory and CPU usage grow exponentially with dimension. For example:\n\n- A 3D PDE on a \\(800\\times 800\\times 800\\) grid is already *borderline feasible* on a large workstation or small cluster.  \n- A 6D PDE (e.g., a Hamiltonian system with 3 positions + 3 momenta) would need a grid on the order of \\(N^6\\), which becomes huge even for modest \\(N\\).  \n\nBecause chaotic systems can also develop *very fine filaments* in the density, standard grid-based methods must refine aggressively (or use adaptive mesh refinement) to capture these filaments without artificially diffusing them away.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Numerical \u201cfilamentation\u201d and artificial smoothing\n\nChaotic flows produce exponential stretching and folding in phase space. In PDE terms, that means the density \\(\\rho\\) rapidly develops **steep gradients**\u2014the filaments you see in a scatter plot of millions of particle trajectories. \n\nAny **grid-based PDE solver** introduces numerical diffusion unless it\u2019s extremely high order and/or uses specialized advection schemes (and even then, you need *unbelievable* resolution). Hence it is difficult to keep the filaments from getting \u201cwashed out.\u201d Particle-based methods (i.e., direct Monte Carlo or Lagrangian simulations) remain popular precisely because they *automatically* track filaments on whatever scale you choose, as long as you have enough particles.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Are there serious attempts?\n\n1. **In low dimensions (1D\u20133D)**: Yes, people *do* solve Liouville- or Vlasov-type PDEs for chaotic or near-chaotic systems in relatively low dimensions. Examples include:\n\n   - **2D Hamiltonian systems**: E.g., the standard map, or 2D incompressible flows, sometimes studied with PDE-based approaches (Liouville/continuity equations).  \n   - **Vlasov\u2013Poisson** or **Vlasov\u2013Maxwell** equations in plasma physics: People solve these in 1D or 2D in space, plus velocity dimensions\u2014though these codes often rely on specialized, high-order (semi-Lagrangian) or particle-in-cell methods to minimize numerical diffusion.  \n\n2. **Koopman operator approaches**: There is a growing community around data-driven methods (e.g., *Dynamic Mode Decomposition* (DMD), *Koopman operator*) that effectively describe how densities evolve under a flow. While not always a direct PDE solver, these methods aim to approximate the infinite-dimensional operator that propagates observables in time. For truly chaotic systems, you can at least approximate certain long-term statistics and coherent structures, but capturing fine-scale filaments remains challenging.\n\n3. **Climate, weather, and ensemble forecasts**: Weather and climate models conceptually integrate huge ensembles in an extremely high-dimensional phase space, but typically in a *particle-like approach* or *ensemble-based approach* (e.g., Ensemble Kalman Filters), rather than solving a single PDE for the density. That is more tractable and ties into assimilation of real data.\n\n---\n\n## 4. (Im)Practicality\n\n- **Exact PDE approach in high dimension?** Generally **impractical** due to the curse of dimensionality and the fact that chaotic mixing demands *very* fine resolution to avoid numerical diffusion.  \n- **Hybrid or specialized methods?** There *are* niche methods that can handle moderate-dimensional Liouville/Vlasov problems using **adaptive grids** or **semi-Lagrangian** methods (which track characteristics in phase space and then remap onto a grid). These can be quite powerful for 2D or 3D flows and can capture filamentation better than naive finite-difference methods. But once you reach dimension 4 or higher, the costs typically blow up.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n1. **Yes, there have been \u201cserious attempts,\u201d** especially in plasma physics, plasma\u2013fluid interactions (the Vlasov equation), and certain classical mechanics toy models. But these are usually in 2D\u20133D phase space, use specialized *semi-Lagrangian* or *high-order* methods, and often require supercomputer-scale resources.  \n2. For **genuinely large** (or even moderately large) chaotic systems in 4D\u20136D or more, fully resolving the PDE for the density becomes **impractical**. Instead, scientists tend to rely on:\n   - **Particle-based** methods (Monte Carlo, direct simulation).  \n   - **Ensemble** or **statistical** approaches (e.g., ensemble forecasts in meteorology).  \n   - **Reduced-order** or **data-driven** models (Koopman operator, machine learning).  \n3. So while nothing prevents you from writing down the Liouville (or deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck) equation for a chaotic system, actually *solving it* in high dimensions with enough resolution to preserve the fine filaments is generally not feasible on finite computing resources."

              "Below are some of the more \u201ccutting-edge\u201d or advanced strategies that people use (or *could* use) to simulate the **phase-space density** for chaotic systems like the 3D R\u00f6ssler. Each of these methods addresses\u2014one way or another\u2014the key challenge of **filamentation** and the **curse of dimensionality**, trying to preserve fine-scale structure without incurring overwhelming computational cost.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Semi-Lagrangian (Characteristic-Based) PDE Solvers\n\n**Why?**  \nStandard finite-difference/finite-volume methods on a fixed grid tend to introduce *artificial diffusion* (blurring out filaments) unless you crank the resolution to extreme levels. **Semi-Lagrangian** schemes try to trace back along *characteristics* (i.e., the flow lines in phase space) to update \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\). This can drastically reduce numerical diffusion.\n\n**How it works (schematically):**  \n1. Instead of doing a local finite-difference update \\(\\rho^{n+1} = \\rho^n + \\dots\\), you interpret the PDE\n\n   \\[\n   \\partial_t \\rho + (f \\cdot \\nabla)\\rho = 0\n   \\]\n\n   as \u201c\\(\\rho\\) is constant along characteristics.\u201d  \n2. For each grid cell at time \\(t^{n+1}\\), you trace backward in time (using \\(-f\\)) to find where that fluid element was at time \\(t^n\\).  \n3. You **interpolate** the old density there to get the new density.  \n\n**Advantages:**  \n- Significantly lower numerical diffusion.  \n- Can be combined with **high-order interpolation** (e.g., spline, WENO interpolation).  \n- Possible to incorporate **adaptive mesh** (AMR) to refine cells around emerging sharp gradients.\n\n**Drawbacks:**  \n- Implementation complexity can be high (especially in 3D).  \n- You may still need to re-mesh or do some form of interpolation that can introduce small errors.  \n\nNevertheless, in fluid and plasma physics (Vlasov solvers), semi-Lagrangian methods are often considered state-of-the-art for capturing filamentation without resorting to massive grid refinement.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) or Wavelet-Based Grids\n\n**Why?**  \nChaotic flows will develop structures at a huge range of scales, but *not* uniformly everywhere in phase space. If you use a uniform \\(800^3\\) grid, much of that resolution may be \u201cwasted\u201d on regions of no interest, while filaments in other regions are under-resolved.\n\n**Key idea:**  \n- **AMR** dynamically refines the grid in regions where \\(\\rho\\) (or its gradients) exceed certain thresholds.  \n- **Wavelet-based** or **multi-resolution** grids can automatically concentrate resolution near filaments.\n\n**Practical notes:**  \n- AMR PDE solvers exist for advection problems but can be quite complex to implement in 3D.  \n- Typically used in astrophysics, fluid dynamics, and plasma codes (e.g. FLASH, Enzo, and others).  \n- Even with AMR, fully resolving tiny filaments in a *highly* chaotic system may require large-scale supercomputing resources.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Particle-in-Cell (PIC) or Hybrid Particle\u2013Grid Methods\n\n**Why?**  \n\u201cPure\u201d particle simulations (i.e., direct Monte Carlo) capture filaments naturally, but if you want a *density field*, you still need some way to deposit or smooth the particle data onto a grid (for visualization or further PDE coupling). Naive histogramming can be noisy or require large particle counts.\n\n**Particle-in-Cell (PIC)** approach:  \n1. Store the distribution as a set of \u201cmacro-particles\u201d that move along the R\u00f6ssler flow.  \n2. Periodically (or every timestep), **deposit** these macro-particles onto a grid to build an approximation to \\(\\rho\\).  \n3. Possibly re-sample or \u201csmooth\u201d the distribution to keep particle noise under control.  \n\n**Advantages:**  \n- Lagrangian tracking of filaments (reduced numerical diffusion).  \n- The grid is used only for diagnosing or coupling (e.g., if you had an additional PDE for coupling fields).  \n\n**Drawbacks:**  \n- Particle noise or sampling errors require large ensembles.  \n- If you do frequent re-sampling or smoothing, that can introduce its own diffusion or bias.\n\nNevertheless, **PIC** or \u201cparticle\u2013mesh\u201d methods strike a balance between purely Lagrangian simulations and purely Eulerian PDE solvers.\n\n---\n\n## 4. High-Order Advection Schemes (WENO, Discontinuous Galerkin, Spectral, etc.)\n\nIf you prefer a more \u201cclassical\u201d PDE route (on a *fixed* or *semi-fixed* grid), the best bet is to use modern **high-order** advection schemes with strong built-in *limiters* that minimize numerical diffusion and dispersion:\n\n- **WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory)**  \n- **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)**  \n- **Spectral methods** (if domain geometry and boundary conditions permit)  \n\nEach of these can better maintain steep gradients and reduce *artificial* smoothing of filaments\u2014up to a point. You\u2019ll still need:\n\n1. High resolution in space (and time steps that respect the CFL condition).  \n2. Possibly some adaptivity if you want to chase down the *smallest* scales.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Data-Driven / Koopman Operator / Reduced-Order Methods\n\nA more recent \u201ccutting-edge\u201d direction, especially in dynamical systems:\n\n1. **Koopman Operator / DMD (Dynamic Mode Decomposition)**:  \n   - Instead of directly evolving \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) on a grid, one can try to approximate the **Koopman operator** that propagates observables or densities forward in time.  \n   - In principle, the Koopman operator is infinite-dimensional, but one tries to build a **finite-rank approximation** from data (snapshots of \\(\\rho\\) or of ensembles).  \n   - Can reveal coherent structures and long-time behavior in a more compressed basis.\n\n2. **Reduced-order modeling**:  \n   - If the attractor has some low-dimensional manifold or if certain large-scale structures dominate, you can attempt a lower-rank projection.  \n   - This is more *heuristic* or *modeling* than a brute-force PDE solve.  \n\n3. **Neural PDE Solvers / Operator Learning**:  \n   - Techniques like **Fourier Neural Operators**, **Neural ODEs**, or **PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks)** can attempt to learn solutions or solution operators directly from data.  \n   - While promising, they are still under heavy research for truly chaotic, high-dimensional PDEs.  \n\nThese approaches might not (yet) be the \u201cdrop-in replacement\u201d for direct PDE or particle methods if your goal is very high-fidelity filaments, but they can be interesting for exploring attractor geometry, building surrogates, or extracting large-scale/statistical features.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Massive Parallelization / GPU-Acceleration\n\nRegardless of method (grid-based, semi-Lagrangian, particle-based), large-scale **parallel computing**\u2014including **GPU acceleration**\u2014has become a de facto \u201ccutting-edge\u201d approach. For instance, if you:\n\n1. Use **particle-based** methods, you can track tens of millions or billions of particles in parallel on GPUs.  \n2. Use **semi-Lagrangian** PDE solvers, you can accelerate the characteristic backtrace step on GPU.  \n\nThis can push the limits of resolution and number of particles, helping you see finer filaments over longer times.\n\n---\n\n## Which Method for the 3D R\u00f6ssler?\n\n1. **Short-time Filamentation**:  \n   - A well-implemented **semi-Lagrangian** or **high-order WENO** scheme on a moderate 3D grid (plus AMR if possible) might capture filaments nicely for a while\u2014until scales become too small.  \n\n2. **Long-time Chaotic Attractor**:  \n   - A straightforward **particle ensemble** (or PIC) is often easier to manage. You can keep injecting or re-sampling particles to maintain resolution in the filaments you care about.  \n   - If you just want the *long-term distribution* (the invariant measure on the R\u00f6ssler attractor), you can run a big particle simulation and gather statistics once transients die out.  \n\n3. **Large HPC / GPU**:  \n   - If you really need to push to large times with minimal smoothing, combine a large particle ensemble (or semi-Lagrangian method) with a GPU-based code.  \n\n4. **Data-Driven or Koopman** (for deeper insight):  \n   - If your goal is more about analyzing *structure* or *coherent sets* in the chaotic flow (rather than a brute-force PDE solution), you can investigate dynamic mode decomposition or Koopman-based analyses.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n- For a **3D** chaotic system like the R\u00f6ssler, **fully resolving the PDE** (Liouville / deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck) on a uniform fine grid is *theoretically* possible but *impractical* for long times due to filamentation. \n- **Cutting-edge** solutions rely on:\n  1. **Semi-Lagrangian** or **particle-based** advection (to avoid severe numerical diffusion).  \n  2. **Adaptive mesh** or refinement strategies (to selectively capture filaments).  \n  3. **High-performance parallel computing** to handle the large memory and CPU demands.  \n  4. Possibly **data-driven** or **reduced-order** approaches if your goal is more about the statistical or global behavior than brute-force filaments.\n\nNo single method is a \u201cmagic bullet,\u201d but these are the primary avenues researchers pursue to handle the intrinsic challenges of simulating high-dimensional chaotic flow densities."

              "Below is a conceptual picture of how **equilibrium (fixed) points**\u2014i.e., where \\(f(\\mathbf{x})=0\\)\u2014and the **inverse velocity** \\(1/f\\) enter into the **deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck (or Liouville) flow** and why they matter.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Zeros of the Velocity Field = Equilibrium Points\n\nIn the R\u00f6ssler system (or any ODE \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=f(\\mathbf{x})\\)), a point \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) with \\(f(\\mathbf{x}^*)=0\\) is an **equilibrium** (or fixed) point of the flow. From the perspective of the **deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck / Liouville equation**,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}\n\\;=\\;\n-\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\;f(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr],\n\\]\n\n- A **fixed point** in \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)-space means that if any particles (trajectories) start **exactly** at \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\), they *remain* there forever.  \n- In the PDE language, \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x}^*, t)\\) is being advected by \\(\\mathbf{0}\\). So locally around that point, there is *no* \u201cflow\u201d in the usual sense\u2014any movement away from or toward \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) depends on how \\(f\\) behaves *near* the equilibrium.\n\n### Stable vs. Unstable Equilibria\n\n- If \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is a **stable equilibrium** (e.g., all eigenvalues of \\(\\mathrm{D}f\\) have negative real parts), nearby trajectories spiral in and remain there.  \n  - In the PDE picture, density can **accumulate** around that point because the local flow is contracting.  \n- If \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is **unstable**, trajectories move away from it.  \n  - In the PDE, density tends to get \u201crepelled\u201d from that neighborhood (except for the measure that starts exactly at the equilibrium).\n\nIn chaotic systems like R\u00f6ssler, you often have **saddles** or more complicated equilibria, and the global density evolution depends on stable/unstable manifolds emanating from these points.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. The Role of the Inverse Velocity \\(1/f\\)\n\nWhen we talk about the **inverse velocity** \\(1/f(\\mathbf{x})\\), we usually mean something in the context of **characteristics** for the PDE. For a purely advective PDE,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}\n+ \\nabla \\cdot \\bigl(\\rho\\,f\\bigr) \n= 0,\n\\]\n\nwe can integrate \u201cbackwards along characteristic curves\u201d to update \\(\\rho\\). This approach effectively uses\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x}(t+\\Delta t) \n\\;=\\; \n\\mathbf{x}(t) + \\Delta t\\,f(\\mathbf{x}(t)) \n\\quad\n\\Longrightarrow\n\\quad\n\\mathbf{x}(t) \n\\;=\\; \n\\mathbf{x}(t+\\Delta t) \n- \\Delta t\\,f(\\mathbf{x}(t)).\n\\]\n\n**If** you try to formally \u201csolve\u201d for \\(\\Delta t = (\\mathbf{x}(t+\\Delta t) - \\mathbf{x}(t))/f(\\mathbf{x}(t))\\), you might write something like \u201c\\(\\Delta t = \\Delta x/f(\\mathbf{x})\\).\u201d But this gets messy exactly where \\(f(\\mathbf{x})=0\\). In other words:\n\n> **Where \\(f(\\mathbf{x})=0\\), the quantity \\(1/f(\\mathbf{x})\\) becomes singular (a pole).**\n\n### Poles and How They Affect the Flow\n\n1. **Numerical / Method-of-Characteristics Issue**  \n   If you rely on \u201cbacktracking\u201d with \\(\\Delta \\mathbf{x}/f(\\mathbf{x})\\), then at or near a zero of \\(f\\), you are dividing by a very small (or zero) velocity. That can create *numerical* singularities or undefined characteristic curves.  \n\n2. **Physical / PDE Meaning**  \n   - At exactly the equilibrium, the flow vector is \\(\\mathbf{0}\\), so that \u201cfluid parcel\u201d in phase space is stationary if it\u2019s *exactly* on that point.  \n   - If the equilibrium is stable, density can \u201cpile up,\u201d and near that point you may see large gradients in \\(\\rho\\).  \n   - If it\u2019s unstable, that region tends to repel density in phase space.  \n\n3. **Local Divergence**  \n   Remember the PDE is \\(- \\nabla \\cdot (f\\,\\rho)\\). If the Jacobian \\(\\nabla \\cdot f\\) is negative near a stable equilibrium, you might get local compression (and a blow-up in \\(\\rho\\) if there\u2019s no diffusion). If \\(\\nabla \\cdot f\\) is positive near an unstable equilibrium, you get local expansion, thinning out \\(\\rho\\).  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Putting It All Together\n\n- The **zeros** of \\(f\\) are topological \u201canchors\u201d of the flow in phase space. They determine where the density may accumulate or from where it may be repelled.  \n- In the **characteristic** viewpoint, you inevitably encounter a **singularity** in the backward-mapping formula near these points (because it involves dividing by \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\)).  \n- However, in the PDE sense, the solution can still be well-defined at an equilibrium\u2014nothing is \u201cwrong\u201d physically. You just have to treat such points carefully in a numerical scheme.  \n\n### Practical Consequences\n\n1. **In purely advective PDEs (like zero-diffusion Fokker\u2013Planck / Liouville)**, stable equilibria can lead to infinite-time \u201caccumulation\u201d of density if trajectories converge there. Unstable ones push density away.  \n2. **For characteristic-based (semi-Lagrangian) solvers**, you often want to detect zeros of \\(f\\) (or near-zeros) so you don\u2019t inadvertently divide by a very small velocity. The solver might require special logic near those equilibria.  \n3. **Chaos and Filaments**: In a chaotic system, you typically also have periodic orbits, strange attractors, etc. The equilibria are just the simplest \u201cstationary sets,\u201d but the overall fractal structure might still revolve around stable/unstable manifolds connected to them.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Role of Zeros**: They are the fixed points where \\(\\rho\\) stops moving locally. In a dynamical sense, these points can be attractors, repellers, or saddles, shaping how density flows in phase space.  \n- **Role of \\(1/f\\)**: Formally arises in characteristic (backtracking) methods to solve the PDE. Poles in \\(1/f\\) (i.e., where \\(f=0\\)) can cause numerical singularities, but physically just indicate \u201cno movement\u201d at that point.  \n\nHence, while the **zeros of \\(f\\)** are perfectly legitimate equilibria in the flow (and the PDE remains well-defined), the **inverse velocity** near those points must be handled carefully in any numerical method\u2014those \u201cpoles\u201d do not break the PDE, but they do require special attention."

For the R\u00f6ssler vector field\n\\[\nf_1=-y-z,\\quad\nf_2=x+a\\,y,\\quad\nf_3=b + z(x-c),\n\\]\nthe divergence is\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot f \\;=\\;\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x}\n+ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y}\n+ \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial z}.\n\\]\n- \\(\\partial f_1/\\partial x = \\partial(-y-z)/\\partial x = 0\\).  \n- \\(\\partial f_2/\\partial y = \\partial(x+a\\,y)/\\partial y = a\\).  \n- \\(\\partial f_3/\\partial z = \\partial\\bigl(b + z(x-c)\\bigr)/\\partial z \n     = x-c.\\)\n\nThus,\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot f \\;=\\; a + (x - c).\n\\]\n\n### Evaluating at each equilibrium:\n\n- **At \\(\\mathbf{x}_1^*\\approx(5.6931,\\,-28.4656,\\,28.4656)\\):**  \n  \\(\\nabla\\cdot f \\;=\\; 0.2 + 5.6931 - 5.7 \\;\\approx\\; 0.1931.\\)  \n  Hence,\n  \\[\n    \\bigl.\\partial_t \\rho\\bigr|_{\\mathbf{x}_1^*}\n    \\;=\\;\n    -\\,0.1931 \\,\\rho(\\mathbf{x}_1^*).\n  \\]\n  Since \\(0.1931>0\\), the factor in front is \\(-\\,0.1931\\).  \n  \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) \\(\\partial_t\\rho(\\mathbf{x}_1^*)\\) is **negative** if \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x}_1^*)>0\\).  \n  In other words, \\(\\rho\\) **decays** exponentially at that point.  \n\n- **At \\(\\mathbf{x}_2^*\\approx(0.00688,\\,-0.0344,\\,0.0344)\\):**  \n  \\(\\nabla\\cdot f \\;=\\; 0.2 + 0.00688 - 5.7 \\;\\approx\\; -5.49312.\\)  \n  Hence,\n  \\[\n    \\bigl.\\partial_t \\rho\\bigr|_{\\mathbf{x}_2^*}\n    \\;=\\;\n    -\\,\\bigl(-5.49312\\bigr)\\,\\rho(\\mathbf{x}_2^*)\n    \\;=\\;\n    +5.49312\\;\\rho(\\mathbf{x}_2^*).\n  \\]\n  This is **positive**, so \\(\\rho\\) **grows** exponentially if there is any nonzero density at \\(\\mathbf{x}_2^*\\).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Interpreting local exponential growth/decay in a chaotic system\n\n### 2.1 Why does one equilibrium \u201cgrow\u201d \\(\\rho\\) while the other \u201cshrinks\u201d it?\n\n- In the purely deterministic (\\(0\\)-diffusion) Fokker\u2013Planck context,  \n  \\(\\nabla\\cdot f(\\mathbf{x}^*) < 0\\) implies **local volume contraction** in phase space, which in turn implies **local increase** in \\(\\rho\\).  \n  \\(\\nabla\\cdot f(\\mathbf{x}^*) > 0\\) implies **local volume expansion** in phase space, hence **local decrease** in \\(\\rho\\).  \n\n- Equilibria with negative divergence often turn out to be (at least partially) stable or \u201csaddle\u201d with an attracting submanifold, whereas those with positive divergence are partially repelling.  \n\n- The sign of \\(\\nabla\\cdot f\\) at an equilibrium does **not** alone guarantee global stability/instability for the entire flow\u2014just the local tendency for nearby trajectories (in one or more directions). In high-dimensional chaotic flows, many equilibria turn out to be saddles (some directions stable, others unstable).\n\n### 2.2 Does the \u201cblowing up\u201d equilibrium dominate the entire distribution?\n\nNot necessarily. Even though \\(\\partial_t\\rho\\) is positive at \\(\\mathbf{x}_2^*\\), that only applies **if** trajectories in some neighborhood actually get pulled in. If, from the full ODE viewpoint, \\(\\mathbf{x}_2^*\\) is a *saddle* or *unstable* in one or more directions, most initial conditions in phase space might get swept away from that point rather than converge to it.\n\nIn chaotic systems (like the R\u00f6ssler at these parameters), **typical trajectories do not settle** onto a stable equilibrium; they end up on a **chaotic attractor** (a strange attractor). From the PDE viewpoint (Liouville equation), the density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) will concentrate **on** or **along** that attractor in the long run. That final limiting measure is often a fractal-like **SRB measure** (Sinai\u2013Ruelle\u2013Bowen measure) supported on the chaotic set\u2014**not** on the equilibrium itself.\n\n### 2.3 Fractal distribution vs. delta at the equilibrium\n\n- In a purely **deterministic** R\u00f6ssler system with chaotic parameters, **both** equilibria are generally unstable (or at best, one might be a saddle). That means almost no typical trajectories end up parked at either fixed point for large \\(t\\).  \n\n- Consequently, in the Fokker\u2013Planck sense, you do *not* see all the probability mass \u201ccollapsing\u201d into one equilibrium to form a delta function (which would be the case for a globally stable node).  \n\n- **Instead,** the density \u201cflows\u201d onto the chaotic attractor and remains spread out in a complicated, folded/filamented pattern. In the infinite-time limit (assuming no diffusion and a \u201cgeneric\u201d initial density that intersects the basin of the attractor), \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) will converge to a measure supported on that attractor\u2014often a fractal distribution.  \n\nHence, even though locally near \\(\\mathbf{x}_2^*\\) you see a positive rate of change for \\(\\rho\\), in practice only initial conditions lying exactly on the stable manifold of that equilibrium (if it exists) would accumulate there. For almost all other initial conditions, the global chaotic dynamics push them elsewhere, into the strange attractor\u2019s dynamics.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n1. **Local rate of change \\(\\partial_t \\rho\\) at each equilibrium** is given by  \n   \\(\\displaystyle \\partial_t \\rho(\\mathbf{x}^*) = -\\,\\bigl[\\nabla \\cdot f(\\mathbf{x}^*)\\bigr]\\,\\rho(\\mathbf{x}^*)\\).  \n   - The \u201clarge-\\(x\\)\u201d equilibrium \\(\\mathbf{x}_1^*\\) has \\(\\nabla\\cdot f>0\\), so \\(\\rho\\) *decays* locally there.  \n   - The \u201csmall-\\(x\\)\u201d equilibrium \\(\\mathbf{x}_2^*\\) has \\(\\nabla\\cdot f<0\\), so \\(\\rho\\) *grows* locally there.\n\n2. **However,** in a genuinely chaotic R\u00f6ssler regime (like \\(a=0.2,b=0.2,c=5.7\\)), *both* equilibria are typically unstable or saddles. **Most** trajectories do not converge to an equilibrium; rather, they roam on (or approach) a chaotic attractor.\n\n3. **Therefore,** the global, long-time solution \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) in the zero-diffusion limit typically evolves into a **fractal-like invariant measure** on the strange attractor (an SRB measure), *not* a delta function at one of the equilibria. The local \u201cinfinite growth\u201d at \\(\\mathbf{x}_2^*\\) does not dominate globally unless that equilibrium happens to be a stable sink for *all* (or almost all) initial conditions\u2014which it isn\u2019t at these standard R\u00f6ssler parameters.\n\nSo, in short:  \n- **Yes**, one equilibrium exhibits local density growth, the other exhibits local density decay.  \n- **No**, that does **not** imply that all probability mass ends up concentrated at the growing equilibrium. In a chaotic regime, the long-term distribution is typically a (fractal) measure supported on the strange attractor, not on an equilibrium."

              "First, let\u2019s restate the question in simpler terms:\n\n> In a **chaotic** R\u00f6ssler system (or any chaotic flow), the long-time distribution of trajectories in phase space often concentrates on a **fractal attractor**. Mathematically, how do we explain that this attractor still carries a \u201cfinite total probability\u201d (i.e., integrates to 1) even though it might be a set of zero volume in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\)? Why don\u2019t all trajectories collapse onto an equilibrium or spread uniformly in the entire domain?\n\nBelow is a sketch of the relevant concepts:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Invariance and the Liouville (Deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck) Equation\n\nIn the zero-diffusion limit, the evolution of a density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) in phase space under a velocity field \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) is given by the **Liouville** (or deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck) equation:\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t\\,\\rho \\;=\\; -\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\bigl[\\rho\\,f(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr].\n\\]\n\n- An **invariant measure** \\(\\rho^*(\\mathbf{x})\\) (time-independent) is one that satisfies\n  \\[\n  \\nabla\\cdot\\bigl[\\rho^*(\\mathbf{x})\\,f(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr] \\;=\\; 0,\n  \\]\n  so that \\(\\partial_t\\,\\rho^*=0\\).  \n\n- Physically, this means that if you initialize \\(\\rho\\) to \\(\\rho^*\\) at \\(t=0\\), it *remains* that way for all time under the flow.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Chaotic Attractors and SRB Measures\n\nFor **chaotic** systems such as the R\u00f6ssler at certain parameters \\((a,b,c)\\):\n\n1. There might be **equilibria** \\((x^*,y^*,z^*)\\), but these are often *unstable* or saddle-like\u2014meaning typical trajectories *do not* converge there.  \n2. Instead, most initial conditions \u201csettle\u201d onto a **chaotic (strange) attractor** that has a fractal geometry (non-integer Hausdorff dimension, complicated folded structure, etc.).  \n\nMathematically, we say that **typical orbits** (under the flow) spend most of their time in the neighborhoods of that attractor, eventually never leaving. In the continuum density picture (Liouville equation), we likewise get a **limiting distribution** \\(\\rho^*(\\mathbf{x})\\) that is:\n\n- Supported **on** the fractal attractor.  \n- **Normalized** to have total probability 1 (i.e., \\(\\int \\rho^*\\,d^3x=1\\)).  \n- Typically **singular** with respect to the ambient 3D volume measure (Lebesgue measure).  \n\nSuch a measure is often called a **Sinai\u2013Ruelle\u2013Bowen (SRB) measure** in dynamical-systems theory. \n\n> **Key Point:** A measure can be *concentrated* on a fractal set of Lebesgue measure zero, yet still be a perfectly valid probability measure of total mass 1.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why It\u2019s Still a \u201cFinite Probability\u201d on a Fractal\n\nA fractal attractor in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) might have zero volume in the usual sense\u2014but that does *not* prevent a probability measure from \u201cliving\u201d on it. Here\u2019s how to see it more concretely:\n\n1. **Analogy with a line or curve in 2D**: A line in the plane has zero area, but you can still place a \u201cline density\u201d on it so that the total mass is 1.  \n2. **Normalization**: The Liouville equation (with incompressible or partially compressible flow) preserves the total integral of \\(\\rho\\). Over time, \\(\\rho\\) gets \u201cfolded\u201d and \u201cstretched\u201d into the chaotic attractor, so that eventually \\(\\rho\\) is concentrated on that set.  \n3. **Singular but integral = 1**: The resulting \\(\\rho^*\\) is *singular* (it does not look like a smooth function in 3D). It is more like a \u201cgeneralized function\u201d (a measure) that is zero \u201calmost everywhere\u201d in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) except on the fractal attractor. But mathematically, the measure of that fractal set under \\(\\rho^*\\) is **exactly 1**.\n\nHence, you get a finite total probability\u2014just distributed in a measure that is not absolutely continuous with respect to the standard volume.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why We Don\u2019t End Up at an Equilibrium\n\nEven though the **local divergence** at one equilibrium might be negative\u2014naively suggesting a local density \u201cblow-up\u201d\u2014the global dynamics can still eject trajectories away from that equilibrium if it is *unstable* in other directions. In a genuinely chaotic regime, almost no initial condition ends up *stuck* at an equilibrium. Instead:\n\n- The state space \u201cfunnels\u201d trajectories onto the attractor through stable manifolds in some directions, but also \u201crepels\u201d them in others (unstable manifolds).  \n- The net effect is that the flow organizes itself into a complicated, fractal set (the attractor) where trajectories remain trapped but keep moving (chaotically).  \n- In the limit \\(t\\to\\infty\\), the **measure** \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) converges to an **invariant SRB measure** concentrated on that set.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Fractal Distributions in the Deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck Sense\n\nIn the purely deterministic (zero diffusion) case:\n\n- **Fine Filaments**: Because of exponential stretching and folding, \\(\\rho\\) develops extremely thin filaments that interlace throughout the attractor.  \n- **Numerical Resolution**: On a computer, those filaments can be *practically* impossible to resolve on a fixed 3D grid, hence one often sees \u201csmooth\u201d approximations unless you use *very* specialized or high-resolution techniques.  \n- **Mathematically**: The exact solution can converge to a fractal measure that is truly \u201csharp\u201d on a complicated subset.\n\nHence, **finite probability** on a fractal set is explained by the existence of these **invariant** (often SRB) measures that the Liouville equation supports under chaotic flows.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n- **Yes**, you can have a *finite*, normalized probability measure supported on a fractal set of zero volume. This is precisely what happens for chaotic (strange) attractors in many dynamical systems.  \n- **Mathematically**, this measure is a **singular** solution of the Liouville equation but still integrates to 1. It is often referred to as an **SRB measure**.  \n- **Intuition**: Chaotic orbits \u201cpile up\u201d in the fractal attractor\u2019s region, never settling to an equilibrium nor filling the entire space. The limiting measure is neither a delta at an equilibrium nor a uniform distribution, but something in-between\u2014concentrated on the chaotic set with fractal geometry."
