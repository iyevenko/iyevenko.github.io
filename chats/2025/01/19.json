              "Below is a selection of perspectives and formulations that computer scientists and mathematicians have used to describe what an **algorithm** is. Rather than simply repeating \u201can algorithm is a series of steps,\u201d these definitions highlight various conceptual angles\u2014mathematical, practical, philosophical, and so on.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Donald Knuth\u2019s Classic Definition (Practical Perspective)**\n- **Key idea**: Finite, well-defined procedure that solves a problem.\n- **Description**: Knuth emphasized that an algorithm is a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a class of problems. It must be **finite** (both in length and in runtime, assuming inputs are of limited size), **definite** (each step is unambiguous), and **effective** (it can be carried out by some agent\u2014human or machine\u2014with the resources at hand).\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: Knuth\u2019s criteria add constraints like *finiteness* and *definiteness* that push beyond \u201cjust a sequence of steps.\u201d He focuses on the practical implementability of those instructions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Alan Turing\u2019s Church\u2013Turing Perspective (Computability Theory)**\n- **Key idea**: A procedure guaranteed to halt with a correct result for all valid inputs (if the function is computable).\n- **Description**: In Turing\u2019s 1936 paper on computable numbers, he conceived of a \u201cmachine\u201d (now called a Turing machine) that implements an *effective procedure*\u2014meaning that if a function is computable, there exists a Turing machine (an algorithm) that will produce the correct output for any valid input in a *finite* number of steps and then halt.\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: Turing\u2019s approach addresses the **theoretical boundary**: which problems *can* be solved by any algorithm at all? It\u2019s less concerned about how an algorithm is structured and more concerned about the existence of a systematic mechanical procedure that guarantees a halt with an answer.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Stephen Kleene\u2019s \u201cEffective Procedure\u201d (Logical/Foundational Angle)**\n- **Key idea**: Focus on \u201ceffectiveness\u201d as a mechanical, foolproof method requiring no ingenuity to carry out.\n- **Description**: Kleene described an algorithm (or an \u201ceffective procedure\u201d) as something you can execute by following **mechanical rules** without needing any creativity or intuition. Each step is so straightforward that a person or machine could do it purely by following instructions.\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: This definition underscores that algorithms must be \u201cfollowable\u201d blindly and systematically. There\u2019s a strong emphasis on the absence of any need for human insight or guesswork.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Yuri Gurevich\u2019s Abstract State Machine Perspective (Behavioral View)**\n- **Key idea**: An algorithm is a set of transition rules that evolves an abstract state through successive steps.\n- **Description**: Gurevich proposed that an algorithm can be seen as a high-level *state machine*, where each step transforms the global state of a computation according to precise rules. The sequence of states (and transformations) leads from an initial condition to a final outcome.\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: Rather than focusing on the step-by-step instructions for a single executor, this view treats an algorithm as a *formal mechanism* that can be applied to an **abstract state**\u2014including complex data structures. It generalizes beyond the sequential \u201clist of steps\u201d into transformations of entire states.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Marvin Minsky\u2019s Definition (Machine Model Emphasis)**\n- **Key idea**: An algorithm as a logical description of a device\u2019s operation on symbolic data.\n- **Description**: In Minsky\u2019s work on finite and infinite automata, an algorithm corresponds to how a machine (finite automaton, Turing machine, etc.) transitions from one configuration to another. It\u2019s a *complete specification* of how to move from any *configuration* (an input state) to an eventual output.\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: It emphasizes **symbol manipulation**\u2014a core idea that algorithms are about systematically transforming sequences (or states) of symbols. The machine model anchors the notion that algorithms are rules for these transformations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Robert Kowalski\u2019s \u201cAlgorithm = Logic + Control\u201d (Logic Programming)**\n- **Key idea**: Separate the *logic* (the declarative specification of a problem) from the *control* (the procedural mechanism for solving it).\n- **Description**: In logic programming (Prolog, for instance), a program\u2019s logical part states what the goal is, while the control part says *how* that goal is achieved (i.e., how rules are applied, in what sequence, etc.). An algorithm emerges from combining these two facets.\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: This definition breaks an algorithm into two conceptual layers\u2014*what* needs to be computed and *how* to do it\u2014offering a higher-level perspective than just enumerating steps.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Manuel Blum\u2019s Axiomatic Definition (Complexity-Theoretic Approach)**\n- **Key idea**: Characterize algorithms abstractly, focusing on complexity measures and computational resources.\n- **Description**: Blum introduced axioms that formally define the *complexity* of recursive functions\u2014leading to a machine-independent theory of complexity. Here, an algorithm is an object that can be subjected to resource bounds (like time or space), and the definition is couched in abstract, axiomatic terms.\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: This approach prioritizes **measurable complexity**\u2014not just that a procedure exists or terminates, but how efficiently it does so, under a rigorous mathematical framework.\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Harold Stone\u2019s Data Transformation View (Applied Computer Architecture)**\n- **Key idea**: An algorithm as a specific means of transforming input data into output data under a given model of computation.\n- **Description**: Stone points out that **architecture** (the specific hardware or execution model) can shape how we design an algorithm. While an algorithm is still a set of instructions, its essence is in *organizing and transforming* data in a way that is efficient for a particular machine model (parallel, pipelined, etc.).\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: It looks at algorithms as **data-flow** frameworks: how data is read, transformed, and written. This perspective is especially relevant in high-performance computing, where concurrency and memory hierarchies matter deeply.\n\n---\n\n## 9. **Peter Wegner\u2019s Interactive Perspective (Interactive Computation)**\n- **Key idea**: Algorithms can be *interactive*, continuously receiving and responding to external inputs.\n- **Description**: Rather than seeing an algorithm as a static procedure that takes input once and produces output once, Wegner proposed that some algorithms (like operating systems or interactive protocols) involve ongoing interaction with the environment. They never fully terminate in the traditional sense; instead, they define how each input is processed at each stage in real time.\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: It challenges the **traditional** requirement that an algorithm must always halt with a single output. This perspective accommodates modern computing scenarios like real-time systems, distributed processes, and event-driven applications.\n\n---\n\n## 10. **Kolmogorov/Chaitin \u201cAlgorithmic Information\u201d Perspective (Compression and Descriptions)**\n- **Key idea**: An algorithm can be seen as a *compressed description* or \u201cshortest program\u201d for generating a string (or data object).\n- **Description**: In the theory of algorithmic information, an algorithm is essentially the minimal program needed to reproduce a piece of data. This leads to notions of complexity (e.g., Kolmogorov complexity) where the \u201calgorithm\u201d is measured by its length (in bits).\n\n**Why it\u2019s different**: It interprets an algorithm not just as a procedure to *solve* a problem, but as the \u201cshortest possible description\u201d or blueprint for producing data. This ties algorithms intimately to ideas of randomness, complexity, and compressibility.\n\n---\n\n### Takeaways\n\n1. **Algorithm as Mechanism**: Turing\u2019s and Minsky\u2019s definitions highlight *mechanical realizations*\u2014formal machines executing symbol manipulations.  \n2. **Algorithm as Procedure**: Knuth\u2019s and Kleene\u2019s definitions emphasize a *practical procedure* with clarity, termination, and effectiveness.  \n3. **Algorithm as Transformation**: Gurevich, Stone, and Kowalski focus on how state or data is transformed.  \n4. **Algorithm as Abstract Object**: Blum\u2019s and Kolmogorov\u2019s views treat algorithms as formal, axiomatic, or information-theoretic objects.  \n5. **Algorithm as Interaction**: Wegner broadens the scope to continuous or dynamic processes that can include open-ended interaction.\n\nThese varied definitions show that an algorithm can be understood in **multiple dimensions**\u2014the step-by-step instructions are just one part of a broader conceptual landscape that includes computability, data transformation, resource usage, interaction, and more."

              "A useful way to see what is going on is to separate two concepts that often get blurred together:\n\n1. **The physical requirement of unitarity (reversibility).**  \n   In quantum mechanics, the fundamental evolution of the system must be unitary (i.e., reversible) to preserve quantum coherence. As soon as you have an irreversible mapping that discards information (like a classical NAND gate), that operation cannot be represented by a unitary operator. In other words, if you are truly doing \u201cquantum evolution,\u201d it has to be describable by a unitary matrix.\n\n2. **The *algorithmic* desire to reduce states (e.g., sorting, finding a minimum, converging on PDE solutions).**  \n   Classically, these tasks are typically performed by many-to-one operations: multiple different states map to a single next state. That irreversibility is convenient because it \u201cforgets\u201d old details and zeroes in on the answers we want.  \n\nQuantum algorithms *do* effectively lose information when you measure\u2014but crucially, they keep everything reversible *until* the measurement is done. The moment you perform a measurement or let decoherence creep in, you have effectively destroyed part of the wavefunction (or entanglement). Why not do that earlier on purpose, as classical algorithms do?\n\n---\n\n## 1. You *can* do irreversible steps, but then you lose quantum advantage\n\nA quantum circuit is a sequence of unitary (reversible) operations, plus possible measurements. If you introduce true information-erasing steps (i.e. measure qubits and discard them) *during* the quantum algorithm, you effectively turn off the interference and entanglement in those measured qubits. This can destroy the very advantage you were trying to achieve\u2014many quantum algorithms rely on interfering all paths of the computation right up until the measurement.\n\nSo while there\u2019s no *law of nature* preventing you from tossing out information in mid-computation, doing so forfeits many of the unique benefits of quantum information processing. That\u2019s why quantum algorithms are carefully designed so that all the \u201cwork\u201d (interference, amplitude amplification, etc.) happens via reversible gates, and only at the *end* do you measure.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Reversibility doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get classical answers\n\nEven though each gate is a one-to-one (reversible) mapping, by the end of the computation you still \u201ccollapse\u201d to a classical outcome when you measure. That last measurement *is* irreversible from the physics perspective. But it\u2019s done *after* the quantum algorithm has performed all of its internal reversible manipulations. Hence you can still do the same \u201cmany different initial states lead to the same final result\u201d that you\u2019d want\u2014just that the *process* of getting there is done with unitary gates.\n\nA simplified example:\n\n1. Start with many possible classical inputs in superposition.\n2. Evolve them (reversibly) so amplitudes interfere in the \u201cright way.\u201d\n3. Measure the final register, obtaining the single classical answer (which is a \u201ccollapse\u201d and is irreversible).\n\nAt this point, the effect is still \u201cmany states converge to one outcome,\u201d even though the transformation *up to* that point was strictly unitary.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Measurement vs. parasitic information loss\n\n- **Measurement** is a *deliberate* and *controlled* form of \u201closing information\u201d from the wavefunction. You pick the basis, measure your qubits, and retrieve classical bits you care about.\n- **Parasitic loss** (decoherence, unwanted noise) is the *uncontrolled* leakage of quantum information to the environment. This is generally detrimental because it spoils coherence and entanglement in ways you haven\u2019t designed for.  \n\nSo, \u201cparasitic\u201d information loss is precisely the *unintended* version of measurement. If you do it by design, it is simply \u201cmeasurement.\u201d When it happens by accident, it degrades the performance of the quantum algorithm.\n\n---\n\n### Short Answer\n\nQuantum computers don\u2019t *intentionally* lose information mid-computation (the way classical algorithms do with many-to-one maps) because any such irreversible step would break unitarity and destroy the interference patterns at the heart of quantum speedups. Instead, quantum algorithms keep all evolution reversible, and only measure right at the end\u2014where a single outcome is ultimately selected (just like many states collapsing to one). This controlled measurement preserves the quantum advantage."

              "Let\u2019s unpack what\u2019s happening during measurement and why it\u2019s considered an \u201cinformation loss,\u201d even though it\u2019s a **deliberate** and **useful** one (unlike accidental decoherence).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why repeated measurements?\n\nFor many quantum algorithms (e.g. Shor\u2019s factoring, Grover\u2019s search, or even simpler sampling tasks), you do not learn the entire amplitude distribution in a single shot. Instead, you prepare and run the quantum circuit multiple times and measure each time:\n\n1. **One shot \u2192 one classical outcome.**  \n   The quantum state collapses to one outcome in the measurement basis. If you only have this single outcome, you lose all knowledge of the rest of the wavefunction\u2019s amplitudes and phases.\n\n2. **Repeat many times \u2192 build statistics.**  \n   By repeating with the *same* initial state preparation and the *same* circuit, you obtain a *distribution* of outcomes over many shots. From these statistics, you can estimate expectation values, probability distributions, etc.\n\nThus, *yes*, repeated measurement \u201ccollapses\u201d the quantum state each time. You do so on *multiple fresh copies* (or fresh runs) of the same initial state so you can gather enough data. Each individual measurement is an irreversible act, but the *statistical ensemble* of many runs is what gives you meaningful classical data.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Is measurement *always* an information loss?\n\nFrom the standpoint of unitary quantum mechanics, measurement is described (in the simplest textbook view) as a non-unitary \u201ccollapse.\u201d In more modern treatments (e.g. open quantum systems), you can think of it as an entanglement of the system with the measuring device (and the environment) followed by tracing out the unobserved degrees of freedom. **Either way, once you measure, you lose the off-diagonal phase information** in your original state that does not commute with your measurement basis. \n\nIn other words, whatever is *not* encoded in your classical outcome is effectively gone. You can\u2019t \u201cundo\u201d a standard projective measurement and regain the original superposition\u2019s phases (unless you do something exotic like \u201cweak measurement\u201d combined with post-selection, etc.\u2014but that\u2019s another story).\n\nHence measurement is indeed a (controlled) form of *information loss* with respect to the quantum state that existed just before measuring.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Can we quantify how much information is lost?\n\n### 3.1. Single-shot perspective\n\nIf you only do *one* measurement on *one* copy of the state \\(\\lvert \\psi \\rangle\\),\n- Before measurement, the system carries the full amplitude and phase information of \\(\\lvert \\psi \\rangle = \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\lvert i \\rangle.\\)\n- After measurement in the \\(\\{\\lvert i \\rangle\\}\\) basis, you get a single outcome \\(\\lvert k \\rangle\\) with probability \\(\\lvert \\alpha_k \\rvert^2.\\)\n\nFrom that one shot, you learn \u201cthe outcome was \\(\\lvert k \\rangle\\),\u201d but you lose all knowledge of the other amplitudes \\(\\{\\alpha_j\\}\\) for \\(j \\neq k\\). The quantum state is now \\(\\lvert k \\rangle\\). The \u201camount\u201d of lost information is intuitively huge (everything about phases, etc.), but it\u2019s not always straightforward to say \u201cX bits\u201d in a single-shot sense, because the wavefunction amplitude/phase is a continuous-variable object.\n\n### 3.2. Ensemble or repeated-run perspective\n\nTo get an expectation value \\(\\langle \\psi | \\hat{O} | \\psi \\rangle\\) or a distribution \\(\\{|\\alpha_i|^2\\}\\), you run the circuit many times and measure. Over many shots:\n- You gradually estimate \\(\\{|\\alpha_i|^2\\}\\) by counting frequencies of each outcome \\(i\\).\n- Phases that do not affect that measurement basis remain \u201cinaccessible\u201d in any single measurement, but might reveal themselves if you measure in different bases (again, requiring more copies or more runs).\n\nThe *theoretical upper bound* on how much information you can extract from a \\(d\\)-dimensional quantum state (e.g. \\(d = 2^n\\) for \\(n\\) qubits) is finite. In fact, to do **full state tomography** on an unknown \\(n\\)-qubit state, you generally need \\(O(d \\log d) = O(2^n n)\\) measurements (in practice, many distinct measurement bases). Each measurement is partial and destructive, so you keep preparing fresh copies.\n\nFrom an **entropy** viewpoint, one measure of how \u201cmuch is lost\u201d upon a single projective measurement is the difference in the **von Neumann entropy** of the pre-measurement pure state (\\(S(\\lvert \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi \\rvert) = 0\\) for a pure state) versus the classical Shannon entropy of the post-measurement distribution (which might be \\(H(\\{|\\alpha_i|^2\\})\\)). A pure state has zero von Neumann entropy, but upon measuring you get a classical distribution with positive Shannon entropy (unless the state was actually \\(\\lvert i\\rangle\\) to begin with).  \n\nIn a sense, the measurement process transforms \u201cquantum coherence\u201d into \u201cclassical randomness.\u201d A single outcome is extremely partial information about the wavefunction, so from the wavefunction\u2019s perspective, a lot *is* lost. But from the classical perspective, you *gain* a random sample from that distribution.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why is this \u201closs\u201d okay?\n\n- **It\u2019s deliberate, at the end:** You *want* to produce a classical answer.  \n- **Quantum advantage arises pre-measurement:** All the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d (quantum interference, amplitude amplification, entanglement) happens through unitary gates that preserve coherence.  \n- **Measurement is how we read out the result:** Ultimately, you must measure to get a classical bit or number\u2014there\u2019s no other way to extract an answer from a purely quantum system.  \n\nSo yes, from the wavefunction perspective, measurement is *absolutely* an information-destroying step. But you do it **when** and **how** you intend to, to retrieve your final classical result. Unwanted, parasitic loss (like decoherence before the algorithm finishes) is detrimental because it removes coherence in an *uncontrolled* way, spoiling the interference patterns that yield quantum speedups.\n\n---\n\n## Short answer\n\n- **Yes**, measurement is *indeed* an irreversible loss of information about the quantum state\u2019s phases and amplitudes\u2014only one outcome \u201csurvives\u201d (from your perspective).  \n- We *often do need many shots* to build up meaningful classical statistics or expectation values.  \n- You can quantify the \u201clost\u201d coherence via measures such as von Neumann entropy or simply note that a single projective measurement collapses a pure state to an orthonormal basis state.  \n- This loss is entirely *intended* at the final readout (the \u201cdesirable\u201d loss), whereas any *earlier* or **unintentional** decoherence is \u201cparasitic\u201d because it destroys quantum interference too soon and removes your ability to harness quantum speedups."
