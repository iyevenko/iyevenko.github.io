              "First, a key point: **a single histogram and its Shannon entropy** (i.e., \\(-\\sum p_i \\ln p_i\\)) at one grid resolution **is *not*** enough to extract a fractal dimension. The fractal dimension is fundamentally about **scaling** behavior as you change the resolution (or box size). In other words, you cannot simply take one discretization, compute an entropy, and call that the fractal dimension. \n\nBelow is an outline of why this is the case and how you *can* compute fractal dimensions in practice.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why a Single Entropy Value Is Not Enough\n\n- **Fractal dimension** measures how \u201ccomplicated\u201d or \u201cdense\u201d a set (or measure) is as you \u201czoom in.\u201d  \n- For a probability distribution \\(p\\) defined on a set of bins (in your case, an \\(N \\times N \\times N\\) grid in 3D), the Shannon entropy  \n  \\[\n  H = - \\sum_i p_i \\ln p_i\n  \\]\n  is a single global measure at that one resolution (bin size).  \n- To find *any* fractal dimension (box-counting, correlation, information dimension, etc.), one must look at **multiple length scales** (i.e., vary the box size from large to small).  \n- A single histogram at a single grid size can\u2019t tell you how the measure (or set) fills space at *finer* or *coarser* scales. Fractals by definition have nontrivial structure under changes of scale.\n\nHence, the fractal dimension is about the slope of certain log\u2013log relationships (as \\(\\epsilon \\to 0\\)). You need a *series* of histograms (or a method that inherently changes scale) to see how counts, sums of powers of \\(p_i\\), or entropies scale.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common Approaches to Fractal Dimension\n\n### (a) Box-Counting Dimension (aka Capacity Dimension)\n\nA classic approach is the \u201cbox-counting\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d dimension. Conceptually:\n1. Cover the set with boxes of side length \\(\\epsilon\\).\n2. Let \\(N(\\epsilon)\\) be the number of boxes that contain (part of) the set.\n3. If the set is fractal, \\(N(\\epsilon)\\) often scales like\n   \\[\n   N(\\epsilon) \\sim \\epsilon^{-D_{\\text{box}}}.\n   \\]\n4. On a log\u2013log plot (\\(\\ln N(\\epsilon)\\) vs. \\(\\ln (1/\\epsilon)\\)), the slope is the **box-counting dimension** \\(D_{\\text{box}}\\).\n\nFor a probability measure, one often slightly modifies the counting to weigh by the measure rather than a simple \u201coccupied/non-occupied,\u201d but the spirit is the same: *multiple box sizes,* measure how counts (or sums) behave, and look at slopes in log\u2013log space.\n\n---\n\n### (b) Correlation Dimension\n\nVery popular for chaotic attractors or point sets. If you have a discrete set of points \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_M\\}\\) in 3D:\n1. For each point \\(x_i\\), count how many other points fall within distance \\(r\\).\n2. Define the \u201ccorrelation sum\u201d  \n   \\[\n   C(r) = \\frac{1}{M^2} \\sum_{i=1}^M \\sum_{j=1}^M \\Theta\\bigl(r - \\|x_i - x_j\\|\\bigr),\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\Theta(\\cdot)\\) is the Heaviside step function (counts 1 if within \\(r\\), 0 if outside).\n3. If the set is fractal, often  \n   \\[\n   C(r) \\sim r^{D_{\\text{corr}}}\n   \\]\n   for small \\(r\\). In log\u2013log form, \\(\\ln C(r)\\) vs. \\(\\ln r\\) is roughly linear with slope the correlation dimension \\(D_{\\text{corr}}\\).\n\n---\n\n### (c) Information Dimension and Generalized Dimensions\n\nIf you want to use *entropies* directly, you are looking toward the **information dimension** (which is one of the **R\u00e9nyi** or **generalized** fractal dimensions, \\(D_q\\), specifically with \\(q=1\\)). The information dimension \\(D_1\\) can be computed by examining how the Shannon entropy *scales* with the box size \\(\\epsilon\\). \n\n1. Partition your space into boxes (bins) of linear size \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n2. Let \\(p_i(\\epsilon)\\) be the probability mass in the \\(i\\)th box.  \n3. Compute the Shannon entropy at scale \\(\\epsilon\\):\n   \\[\n   H(\\epsilon) \\;=\\; - \\sum_i p_i(\\epsilon)\\,\\ln\\bigl(p_i(\\epsilon)\\bigr).\n   \\]\n4. The information dimension \\(D_1\\) is defined by\n   \\[\n   D_1 \\;=\\; \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{H(\\epsilon)}{\\ln\\!\\bigl(1/\\epsilon\\bigr)}.\n   \\]\n   \nIn practice, you do the following:\n- Choose a range of \\(\\epsilon\\) values (or equivalently, a range of grid sizes).\n- For each \\(\\epsilon\\), compute the histogram-based probabilities \\(p_i(\\epsilon)\\) and their entropy \\(H(\\epsilon)\\).\n- Plot \\(H(\\epsilon)\\) vs. \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\). The slope of this line (if linear in the small \\(\\epsilon\\) regime) is the information dimension.\n\n> Note that if you are in 3D and your set is *fully* volume-filling, you might get a dimension close to 3 (the topological dimension). If it\u2019s a fractal attractor, you\u2019ll get something *less* than 3, and you should see the slope clearly in the log\u2013log or semi-log plot.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical Steps for Your NxNxN Array\n\n1. **Vary the grid size**: Don\u2019t stick to a single \\(N\\times N\\times N\\) partition. You want coarser and finer partitions to see if a fractal-scaling regime emerges.  \n2. **Compute the probability measure** \\(p_i(\\epsilon)\\) at each partition scale (the index \\(i\\) will depend on how many boxes are there for that scale).  \n3. **Sum entropies** (if you\u2019re going for the information dimension) or do \u201cbox counts\u201d (if you want the box-counting dimension).  \n4. **Make a log\u2013log (or suitable) plot** and look for a scaling region where you can extract a slope. That slope is your fractal dimension (of whichever type you chose).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Short Answer\n\n- The single entropy \\(\\sum -p \\ln p\\) at *one* resolution does **not** give you the fractal dimension by itself.  \n- To get a fractal dimension, you *must* look at how measures (box counts, correlation sums, or entropies) scale *across different resolutions*.  \n- If you prefer an entropy-based approach, compute \\(H(\\epsilon) = -\\sum p_i(\\epsilon)\\ln p_i(\\epsilon)\\) *for multiple* \\(\\epsilon\\) (i.e. multiple bin sizes) and plot \\(H(\\epsilon)\\) vs. \\(\\ln (1/\\epsilon)\\). The slope in the small-\\(\\epsilon\\) regime is the **information dimension**, one type of fractal dimension.  \n\nThat is the correct procedure to estimate fractal dimension numerically from a histogram-based approach."

              "First off, you are exactly touching on the difference between a simple \u201cbox-counting dimension\u201d (also called capacity dimension) and the so\u2010called \u201cinformation dimension.\u201d  Once you sum up \\(-p\\log p\\) (the Shannon entropy) in boxes, you have moved away from the simple *occupied vs. unoccupied* thresholding used in box-counting.  In fractal analysis, that \\(-\\sum p \\log p\\) quantity at multiple scales relates to the **information dimension** \\(D_1\\), which is one of the R\u00e9nyi (generalized) fractal dimensions.\n\nBelow is a more direct explanation of how (and why) to handle the entropy-based approach and how it has been done in the literature.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Box-Counting vs. Information Dimension\n\n1. **Box-counting (capacity) dimension**:  \n   - You cover your set with boxes of size \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n   - You count how many boxes are non-empty, call that \\(N(\\epsilon)\\).  \n   - Typically, if the set is fractal, \\(N(\\epsilon) \\sim \\epsilon^{-D_{\\mathrm{box}}}\\).  \n   - You find the slope in a log\u2013log plot:  \n     \\[\n       D_{\\mathrm{box}} \\;=\\; -\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0}\\frac{\\ln N(\\epsilon)}{\\ln \\epsilon}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Information dimension** (the \\(q=1\\) case of R\u00e9nyi dimensions):  \n   - You still cover the set (or distribution) with boxes of linear size \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n   - *But now* let \\(p_i(\\epsilon)\\) be the fraction of the measure (probability) in the \\(i\\)-th box.  \n   - Compute the Shannon entropy at scale \\(\\epsilon\\):  \n     \\[\n       H(\\epsilon) \\;=\\; - \\sum_{i} p_i(\\epsilon)\\,\\log p_i(\\epsilon).\n     \\]\n   - For a fractal measure, it often scales like:  \n     \\[\n       H(\\epsilon) \\;\\sim\\; D_{1}\\,\\log\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{\\epsilon}\\bigr) \n       \\quad \\text{as} \\;\\epsilon \\to 0.\n     \\]\n   - The **information dimension** is defined by:\n     \\[\n       D_{1} \n       \\;=\\; \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0}\\; \\frac{H(\\epsilon)}{\\ln\\!\\bigl(1/\\epsilon\\bigr)}.\n     \\]\n   - The key is to look at how the *entropy* scales with the *log of the inverse box size*.\n\nIn other words, **the slope** of \\(H(\\epsilon)\\) vs. \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\) in the small-\\(\\epsilon\\) regime *is* your fractal dimension (if you are working in an \u201cinformation dimension\u201d sense).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. \u201cThe Magnitude Is Arbitrary\u201d\u2014and Why That\u2019s OK\n\nYou mentioned that when you sum \\(-p\\log p\\) in boxes, the \u201cmagnitude\u201d may seem arbitrary or not obviously giving you a direct dimension.  That\u2019s actually *true* if you look at a single \\(\\epsilon\\)-scale.  Entropy (or even box\u2010counts) at a single scale by itself won\u2019t give you a dimension outright.\n\n- **What removes the arbitrariness** is that fractal dimensions come from how these quantities *scale* with the box size \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n- If you collect data for multiple box sizes \\(\\epsilon\\) (e.g. halving the grid size each time, or some systematic set of \\(\\epsilon\\) values), the *slope* of the function in the log\u2013log or semi-log plot is *independent* of the additive constants or prefactors in your sums.  \n\nHence, your final dimension estimate is not simply the \u201cvalue\u201d of \\(-p\\log p\\) at a single scale, it is the slope of \\(H(\\epsilon)\\) vs. \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\).  That is how you get rid of the offset ambiguity.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical Steps (What Has Been Done Before)\n\n1. **Choose a set of box sizes \\(\\epsilon_k\\)**: for example, in a 3D domain of side length 1, you might choose \\(\\epsilon_k = 1/2^k, 1/3^k, 1/4^k,\\dots\\).  \n2. **Partition** your domain at each \\(\\epsilon_k\\): you get a grid of \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_k}\\right)^3\\) boxes (assuming a unit cube for simplicity).  \n3. **Compute probabilities** \\(p_i(\\epsilon_k)\\) for each box \\(i\\) (i.e., fraction of total mass/points that lie in that box).  \n4. **Compute total Shannon entropy**:  \n   \\[\n     H(\\epsilon_k) = - \\sum_{i} p_i(\\epsilon_k)\\,\\log p_i(\\epsilon_k).\n   \\]\n5. **Plot** \\(H(\\epsilon_k)\\) **versus** \\(\\ln\\bigl(1/\\epsilon_k\\bigr)\\).  \n6. **Extract slope**: in the region where fractal scaling is valid (hopefully a linear range in that plot), the slope is your **information dimension** \\(D_1\\).\n\nThat procedure is exactly *what is done* in many chaotic/complex systems analyses when one wants the *information dimension* from a measure.  (See for example references on \u201cmultifractal analysis,\u201d \u201cR\u00e9nyi dimensions,\u201d or the \u201cGrassberger\u2013Procaccia\u201d style approaches.)\n\n---\n\n### A Note on \u201cR\u00e9nyi Dimensions\u201d in General\n\nOften people go further and define *generalized dimensions* \\(D_q\\) from the sums of \\(p^q\\) in each box.  Specifically,\n\n\\[\n  D_q \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{q-1}\\,\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0}\\,\n           \\frac{\\ln\\!\\Bigl[\\sum_i p_i(\\epsilon)^q\\Bigr]}{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)}.\n\\]\n\n- For \\(q=0\\), \\(D_0\\) is the box\u2010counting (capacity) dimension.  \n- For \\(q=2\\), \\(D_2\\) is the correlation dimension (common in chaos theory).  \n- For \\(q=1\\), you have to handle the limiting case carefully (it becomes the derivative at \\(q=1\\)), but effectively it is the *information dimension*, which uses the Shannon entropy \\(-\\sum p\\ln p\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Takeaways\n\n1. Summing \\(-p \\log p\\) in each box is a standard measure for **information dimension** \u2014but *only* if you examine how it scales for multiple box sizes.  \n2. The absolute or raw value of \\(\\sum -p \\log p\\) at a single scale is not, by itself, your fractal dimension.  \n3. **Look at the slope** of \\(H(\\epsilon)\\) vs. \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\). The slope (in the asymptotic small-\\(\\epsilon\\) regime) is your fractal dimension.  \n4. This is exactly \u201cwhat has been done before\u201d in the context of multifractal analysis or the information dimension approach.\n\nIn short, **the discrepancy you see is resolved** by recognizing that fractal dimension is all about *scaling* and that once you gather data at multiple scales, the \u201carbitrary magnitude\u201d of \\(-p\\log p\\) no longer matters. The fractal dimension emerges from the slope."

              "Below is a concise step\u2010by\u2010step outline for **using your box sizes** 200, 100, 50, 25 in a fractal dimension estimation (whether capacity dimension or information dimension). These steps assume you already have a way to:\n\n1. **Partition** your region (or bounding box of your data) into a grid of a certain \u201cbox size\u201d \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n2. **Count** or **measure** how many boxes are occupied (for box-counting) or how much probability mass each box has (for an entropy or information\u2010dimension approach).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Decide Which Dimension You\u2019re Estimating\n- **Box\u2010counting (capacity) dimension**: you only care about how many boxes are *occupied* at each scale.  \n- **Information dimension**: you care about the probability measure \\(p_i\\) in each box at each scale, and compute an entropy \\(H(\\epsilon)\\).\n\n*(If you want box\u2010counting but are curious about the information dimension, just note the difference in the formula and the final plot. The main difference is in step 4 below.)*\n\n---\n\n## 2. For Each Box Size, Do the Counting/Measuring\n\nLet\u2019s label your box sizes as \\(\\epsilon_1 = 200\\), \\(\\epsilon_2 = 100\\), \\(\\epsilon_3 = 50\\), \\(\\epsilon_4 = 25\\).  \n(If you have an overall domain length \\(L\\), then each \u201cbox\u201d might have side length \\(\\epsilon_k\\), so effectively you have \\(L/\\epsilon_k\\) boxes along each dimension. Or, if you have a discrete NxNxN grid, your \u201cbox size\u201d is how many grid cells you lump together in each dimension.)\n\n1. **Box\u2010counting approach**: \n   - Count the number of boxes \\(N(\\epsilon_k)\\) that are non-empty (i.e. they contain at least one data point) at each box size \\(\\epsilon_k\\).\n\n2. **Information dimension (entropy) approach**: \n   - For each box, determine the probability \\(p_i(\\epsilon_k)\\) of points (or mass) in that box. \n   - Compute the Shannon entropy:\n     \\[\n       H(\\epsilon_k) = - \\sum_i p_i(\\epsilon_k)\\,\\log p_i(\\epsilon_k).\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n## 3. Put Data Into a Table\n\nMake a simple table (or arrays in code) something like:\n\n| Box Size (\\(\\epsilon_k\\)) | #Boxes (maybe \\(B_k\\) = \\((L/\\epsilon_k)^3\\)) | \\(N(\\epsilon_k)\\) if doing box-counting | \\(H(\\epsilon_k)\\) if doing entropy |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| 200                       | \u2026                                            | \u2026                                         | \u2026                                  |\n| 100                       | \u2026                                            | \u2026                                         | \u2026                                  |\n| 50                        | \u2026                                            | \u2026                                         | \u2026                                  |\n| 25                        | \u2026                                            | \u2026                                         | \u2026                                  |\n\nHere:  \n- \\(L/\\epsilon_k\\) is the number of boxes *per dimension*, so the total number of boxes in 3D is \\((L/\\epsilon_k)^3\\), if you are consistently covering the domain.  \n- \\(N(\\epsilon_k)\\) is the count of boxes that actually have data.  \n- \\(H(\\epsilon_k)\\) is the total Shannon entropy if you are doing the measure\u2010based approach.\n\n*(If the domain length \\(L\\) is not 1, just be consistent about your definitions. The key is that box size \\(\\epsilon\\) is how big a single box is. Then the number of boxes per dimension is about \\(\\tfrac{L}{\\epsilon}\\).)*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Plot the Appropriate Relation and Find the Slope\n\n### If You Are Estimating the **Box-Counting Dimension**  \n1. Compute \\(N(\\epsilon_k)\\) = number of occupied boxes for each \\(\\epsilon_k\\).  \n2. Plot \\(\\ln N(\\epsilon_k)\\) vs. \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon_k)\\).  \n3. Look for (roughly) a linear region. The slope of that line is the estimate of the fractal dimension.  \n   \\[\n     D_{\\mathrm{box}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\ln N(\\epsilon)}{\\Delta \\ln (1/\\epsilon)}.\n   \\]\n\n### If You Are Estimating the **Information Dimension**  \n1. Compute the Shannon entropy \\(H(\\epsilon_k)\\).  \n2. Plot \\(H(\\epsilon_k)\\) vs. \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon_k)\\) (or equivalently vs. \\(-\\ln \\epsilon_k\\)).  \n3. Look for a linear region in that plot. The slope is your information dimension \\(D_1\\).  \n   \\[\n     D_{1} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H(\\epsilon)}{\\Delta \\ln (1/\\epsilon)}.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Interpretation and Caveats\n\n1. **Four Scales Might Be Few**: You have only 4 box sizes (200, 100, 50, 25). That\u2019s not many data points to robustly fit a slope in a log\u2013log plot. Often you want 6\u201310 different scales if possible, so you can see whether there\u2019s a consistent scaling regime.  \n2. **Check the Domain Range**: Ensure that these box sizes *actually differ significantly*, and that you\u2019re not saturating at large box sizes or too small box sizes.  \n3. **Logarithmic Plot**: If you do a standard linear regression, be sure you\u2019re regressing `ln(N)` vs. `ln(1/\u03b5)` (for box\u2010counting) or `H(\u03b5)` vs. `ln(1/\u03b5)` (for entropy).  \n4. **Fractal Range**: If your data or attractor has a minimal scale or is basically \u201cfilled\u201d at coarse scales, you may only see a fractal\u2010like slope in some intermediate range of \\(\\epsilon\\).  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Summary of \u201cWhat to Do\u201d\n\n1. **Gather \\(N(\\epsilon_k)\\) or \\(H(\\epsilon_k)\\) for each box size** (200, 100, 50, 25).  \n2. **Compute** \\(\\ln N(\\epsilon_k)\\) and \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon_k)\\) (if box\u2010counting) or just do \\(H(\\epsilon_k)\\) vs. \\(\\ln(1/\\epsilon_k)\\) (if using entropy).  \n3. **Plot** them to see if you get (roughly) a line.  \n4. **Fit** a line to estimate the slope = fractal dimension (capacity or information dimension).  \n\nWith only four points, proceed cautiously\u2014try a simple linear regression and see if the points align well. If they do, then the slope is your approximate fractal dimension."
