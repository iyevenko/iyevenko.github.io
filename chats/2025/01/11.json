              "First, the root cause of the explosion is that your PDE update (an explicit Euler update) with a centered-difference approximation to \\(\\nabla p\\) is not stable for advection-like equations, especially at the boundary. The combination of \u201cadvection in \\(\\mathbf{f}\\)\u201d and \u201ccentered-difference derivative\u201d is a classic recipe for numerical instability\u2014unless you have very restrictive time steps, very small spatial steps, or (more commonly) you switch to a more stable scheme like upwind differencing (or other flux-limited methods) and impose reasonable boundary conditions.\n\nBelow are several ways to address or at least mitigate this numerical blow-up.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Use a Smaller Time Step\n\nFor an explicit scheme, you typically need to satisfy a CFL-like condition for stability in advection problems. Roughly, you need\n\n\\[\n\\Delta t \\;\\lesssim\\; \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\|\\mathbf{f}\\|_\\infty},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta x\\) is your grid spacing (in each dimension) and \\(\\|\\mathbf{f}\\|_\\infty\\) is the maximum speed (max norm of the velocity field). \n\n- If your grid spacing is 1 (since you used `torch.linspace(-50,50,N)` you effectively have \\(\\Delta x = \\frac{100}{N-1}\\approx 0.25\\) for \\(N=400\\)),\n- and your velocity can be up to order ~20 or more (depending on the region in \\((x,y,z)\\) space, because the R\u00f6ssler velocity can be large at certain \\(x,y,z\\)),\n\nthen \\(\\Delta t\\) might need to be a lot smaller than \\(0.001\\). You can experiment by gradually decreasing `dt` (e.g. 1e-4, 1e-5, \u2026) and see if the blow-up disappears. Of course, this can make your simulation very slow.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Impose Boundary Conditions\n\nWhen you compute `torch.gradient(p, dim=(0,1,2))`, PyTorch uses a finite difference that is essentially centered in the interior and \u201cone-sided\u201d at the boundaries by default (depending on `edge_order`). This can introduce large errors at the edges when the field \\( p \\) or velocity \\( \\mathbf{f} \\) is nontrivial near the boundary. \n\nOften, you want to impose a boundary condition for \\( p \\). For example:\n\n- **Periodic** boundary conditions: This may or may not make physical sense for your problem. If it does, you could pad `p` in a wrap-around way so that derivatives at the edge do not blow up.  \n- **Dirichlet** (e.g. \\(p=0\\) on boundary) or **Neumann** (\\(\\nabla p = 0\\) on boundary) boundary conditions: These typically require you to clamp or reflect your field in some manner.\n\nA quick hacky approach is to clamp the values of `p` at the boundary so that they cannot explode (though that can create unphysical reflections). For instance, something like:\n```python\np[..., 0] = p[..., 1]\np[..., -1] = p[..., -2]\n```\n(and similarly in the y, z dimensions) after each step. That enforces a kind of zero-gradient condition. It is not the best from a PDE standpoint, but can keep the code from blowing up.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Use an Upwind (or Otherwise Stable) Scheme for the Advection Term\n\nAdvection-dominated PDEs (like \\( \\partial_t p + \\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla p = 0\\)) are classically solved with *upwind* or *Godunov-type* methods for stability. A naive centered difference on \\(\\nabla p\\) will not be stable in general\u2014unless you reduce \\(\\Delta t\\) drastically.\n\nIn \u201cupwind differencing,\u201d the direction of the velocity \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) determines which neighboring cell you use to approximate the derivative. For a simple 1D example, the upwind derivative is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\Big\\rvert_i \\approx\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{p_i - p_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}, & f > 0, \\\\\n\\frac{p_{i+1} - p_i}{\\Delta x}, & f < 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nIn PyTorch, you\u2019d have to manually implement that logic in 3D for each dimension, which can be a bit involved, but it will be significantly more stable than a centered difference if \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) is large.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Clamp or Filter Out NaNs as a Stopgap\n\nIf you simply need to avoid the solution going NaN for demonstration, you could clamp or filter out large values or NaNs on each step:\n\n```python\np = step(p, f, div_f, dt)\np = torch.nan_to_num(p, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)\np = torch.clamp(p, 0.0, 1e3)\n```\n\nThis does not *fix* the underlying method\u2019s instability, but can keep the code from crashing. You will likely see \u201cringing\u201d or spurious artifacts near the boundaries, though.\n\n---\n\n## Putting It All Together\n\n1. **Reduce your time step** (`dt`) to see if that helps.  \n2. **Impose boundary conditions**: either clamp or replicate the boundary, or implement something physically meaningful if you know the correct boundary condition for your PDE.  \n3. **Use an upwind (or more sophisticated) discretization** for the advection term instead of a naive centered difference.  \n4. Optionally, **filter out** or **clamp** large values/NaNs if you just need the code to keep running, but that\u2019s only a band-aid.\n\nIn practice, numerical stability for advection typically boils down to satisfying the CFL condition and/or choosing an advection scheme designed to be stable (e.g., upwind). Simply using \\(\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}t = -\\nabla p \\cdot \\mathbf{f}\\) with a centered difference and forward Euler in time will almost always blow up eventually.  "

              "Below is an example of how you might implement a **3D upwind scheme** with **reflection (mirror) boundary conditions** in PyTorch, using MPS acceleration. This replaces the naive centered-difference approach for the advection term \\(\\mathbf{f}\\cdot\\nabla p\\).  \n\nKey points:\n1. We **reflect-pad** your scalar field \\(p\\) so that spatial derivatives at the boundary use \u201cmirror\u201d values instead of PyTorch\u2019s default one-sided finite-difference.  \n2. We construct an **upwind difference** in each dimension based on the local sign of the velocity \\(f_d\\).  \n3. We then do an **explicit Euler** time-stepping with that upwind gradient and the divergence term.  \n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\ndevice = 'mps'\ndtype = torch.float32\n\n###############################################################################\n# 1) Define the R\u00f6ssler vector field and its divergence as before\n###############################################################################\ndef rossler_field(N, a, b, c):\n    x, y, z = torch.meshgrid(\n        torch.linspace(-50, 50, N),\n        torch.linspace(-50, 50, N),\n        torch.linspace(0,   50, N),\n        indexing='ij'\n    )\n    dx = -y -

With `mode='reflect'`, PyTorch \u201cmirrors\u201d the boundary values outward, mimicking a reflection boundary condition (sometimes referred to as a \u201cmirror\u201d or \u201cNeumann-like\u201d condition).\n\n2. **Upwind Gradient**  \n   - For each dimension \\(d \\in \\{x,y,z\\}\\), we slice out \\(\\{p_{i-1}, p_{i}, p_{i+1}\\}\\) from the padded tensor.  \n   - If \\(f_d \\ge 0\\), we do a **backward difference** \\((p_i - p_{i-1}) / \\Delta x\\).  \n   - If \\(f_d < 0\\), we do a **forward difference** \\((p_{i+1} - p_i) / \\Delta x\\).  \n   This gives us a stable advection update for typical PDEs of the form \\(\\partial_t p + \\mathbf{f}\\cdot\\nabla p = 0\\), rather than the (often unstable) centered difference.\n\n3. **Timestep**  \n   We do an **explicit Euler** update:\n   \\[\n     p^{n+1} = p^n + \\Delta t \\,\\Bigl(- \\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla_{\\text{upwind}} p^n - \\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{f})\\,p^n\\Bigr).\n   \\]\n   You still must ensure the **CFL condition** is not grossly violated (i.e., pick \\(\\Delta t\\) small enough relative to the maximum velocity and grid size).\n\n4. **MPS Acceleration**  \n   As long as you push your tensors to `device='mps'`, PyTorch should run all operations on Apple Silicon GPU via Metal Performance Shaders. This code uses `torch.jit.script` to give a slight performance boost and preserve the same logic.  \n\nWith this approach, you should see far fewer (or no) spurious instabilities at the boundary compared to the naive centered difference, and your domain edges will be \u201creflected\u201d to help maintain numeric stability."

              "When you say the field is \u201czero on the edges,\u201d that implies you are trying to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions: \\(\\phi=0\\) at the boundary. However, `torch.gradient` by itself does not enforce those boundary conditions. It simply does finite differences at the edges with whichever default \u201cedge behavior\u201d PyTorch uses (which can lead to spurious or large values there).\n\nThis can cause values near the boundary to \u201cexplode\u201d numerically over many time steps, because the gradient operator at or near the boundary picks up erroneous differences instead of true zero-boundary conditions.\n\nBelow are a few guidelines and approaches that can help stabilize your simulation and keep \\(\\phi=0\\) at the edges.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Manually Enforce Boundary Conditions\n\nAfter each update in your time loop, you can manually zero out the boundary values. For a 3D tensor `phi` with shape \\((N_x, N_y, N_z)\\), you might do:\n\n```python\n# Suppose phi is your field. Manually enforce zero boundaries:\nphi[0, :, :]   = 0.0\nphi[-1, :, :]  = 0.0\nphi[:, 0, :]   = 0.0\nphi[:, -1, :]  = 0.0\nphi[:, :, 0]   = 0.0\nphi[:, :, -1]  = 0.0\n```\n\nThis ensures that if you want strict Dirichlet boundary conditions, you re-impose them after each update step.  \n\n**Why it helps**: Even though `torch.gradient` will compute some sort of finite difference near the edges, at least your final update in each time step is forced to respect the boundary condition \\(\\phi=0\\) on the boundary.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Consider How You Compute the Gradient at the Edges\n\nBy default, `torch.gradient(..., edge_order=1)` uses a simple forward/backward difference near the edges. That can amplify spurious values if your field is small but not exactly zero near the boundary.\n\nSometimes, you can \u201cclip\u201d your array to exclude the edges altogether:\n```python\n# For example, compute the gradient only in the interior\ngrad_phi = torch.gradient(phi[1:-1, 1:-1, 1:-1])  \n```\nThen you\u2019d handle the boundaries separately or set them to zero manually.  \n\n**Why it helps**: Excluding the edges from gradient computation ensures no artificial gradient is taken with partial or out-of-bounds data. However, it means you have to be extra careful stitching the domain boundaries back on if needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Use Padding or Custom Finite-Difference Operators\n\nInstead of relying on the default behavior of `torch.gradient`, you can create padded versions of `phi` that are zero beyond the boundary, and then compute centered finite differences away from the edges. For instance:\n```python\n# Pad with one layer of zeros around the domain\nphi_padded = F.pad(phi, (1,1,1,1,1,1), mode='constant', value=0)\n\n# Then compute a centered difference on phi_padded[..., 1:-1, 1:-1, 1:-1]\n# with explicit slices:\ndx = (phi_padded[2:, 1:-1, 1:-1] - phi_padded[:-2, 1:-1, 1:-1]) / (2*delta_x)\n# similarly for dy, dz, etc.\n```\nThis is a more \u201clow-level\u201d approach, but it gives you direct control over how you treat the domain edges.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Check Time-Stepping Stability (CFL Condition)\n\nIf your simulation updates the field in time using an **explicit** scheme (e.g. forward Euler), you should verify the Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy (CFL) condition or its equivalent for your PDE. Even if the boundary is fixed to zero, an overly large time step \\(\\Delta t\\) can cause blow-up near boundaries if your PDE is hyperbolic (wave-like) or parabolic (heat-like).\n\nA typical 3D PDE update might look like:\n\\[\n\\phi^{n+1} = \\phi^n + \\Delta t \\, \\mathcal{D}(\\phi^n),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{D}(\\phi)\\) is some differential operator. If \\(\\Delta t\\) is too large, the method can become unstable regardless of boundary conditions. \n\n**Why it helps**: Reducing \\(\\Delta t\\) (or using an implicit method) can drastically reduce or eliminate those \u201cexplosions.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of Actionable Steps\n\n1. **Zero out edges explicitly**: After each time update, manually set `phi` to zero on the boundary indices.\n2. **Compute gradients only on the interior**: Slice your array to avoid spurious edge computations.\n3. **Use custom differences with padding**: If you need a more controlled finite-difference scheme, manually code your derivative operator with zero-padded data.\n4. **Check time-step size**: Ensure your update step satisfies the relevant stability criterion for your PDE.\n\nBy combining these techniques, you should see the artificial growth at the boundaries subside (or disappear entirely). In many practical PDE solvers, boundary conditions are always enforced **after** each update step, which is likely the simplest robust fix in a PyTorch-based simulation code."

              "Below is a fairly detailed discussion of two main questions:\n\n1. **Is the deterministic (\u201cnoiseless\u201d) Fokker\u2013Planck (really just the continuity / Liouville) equation being implemented correctly?**  \n2. **Why might there be \u201cnoise\u201d or blow-up at the corners of the domain, and how can one mitigate it?**  \n\n---\n\n## 1) Validity of the deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck equation in this code\n\n### Fokker\u2013Planck vs. continuity/Liouville equation\n\n- When the underlying SDE (Stochastic Differential Equation) is purely deterministic \\( \\dot{x} = f(x) \\) with no diffusion/brownian term, then the \u201cFokker\u2013Planck\u201d equation reduces to a **simple continuity (Liouville) equation**:\n  \\[\n    \\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; -\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl(p(x,t)\\,f(x)\\bigr).\n  \\]\n\n- Numerically, this is often expressed as\n  \\[\n    p^{(n+1)} = p^{(n)} \\;-\\; \\Delta t\\;\\nabla\\cdot\\bigl(p^{(n)}\\,f\\bigr).\n  \\]\n\n- Your code,\n  ```python\n  grad = (torch.gradient(p * f[...,0], dim=1)[0] +\n          torch.gradient(p * f[...,1], dim=1)[0] +\n          torch.gradient(p * f[...,2], dim=1)[0])\n  p = p - dt * grad\n  ```\n  is *intended* to do something like\n  \\[\n    p \\;\\leftarrow\\; p \\;-\\; \\Delta t \\,\\bigl[\\partial_x(p\\,f_x) + \\partial_y(p\\,f_y) + \\partial_z(p\\,f_z)\\bigr].\n  \\]\n\n### Potential implementation mistakes\n\n1. **Divergence in 3D**.  For a 3D array \\((N \\times N \\times N)\\), one typically wants:\n   ```python\n   dx = torch.gradient(p * f[..., 0], dim=0)[0]\n   dy = torch.gradient(p * f[..., 1], dim=1)[0]\n   dz = torch.gradient(p * f[..., 2], dim=2)[0]\n   grad = dx + dy + dz\n   p = p - dt * grad\n   ```\n   However, your snippet uses\n   ```python\n   grad = ( torch.gradient(p * f[...,0], dim=1)[0]\n          + torch.gradient(p * f[...,1], dim=1)[0]\n          + torch.gradient(p * f[...,2], dim=1)[0] )\n   ```\n   all along `dim=1`.  That means you\u2019re taking partial derivatives *only* w.r.t. the second axis (presumably \\(y\\)-like). This will not yield the true 3D divergence \\(\\nabla \\cdot (p f)\\).  \n\n   - If your grid is indeed 3D, and if `dim=1` corresponds to just the \\(y\\)-direction, then you\u2019re effectively computing\n     \\[\n       \\partial_y \\bigl(p\\,f_y\\bigr) \\;+\\; \\partial_y\\bigl(p\\,f_y\\bigr) \\;+\\; \\partial_y\\bigl(p\\,f_y\\bigr),\n     \\]\n     which is definitely incorrect.\n\n   - **Fix**: be sure to compute partial derivatives along **all three dimensions**\u2014or at least whichever subset you actually intend to simulate. If it is truly 3D, do `dim=0`, `dim=1`, `dim=2` for each component.\n\n2. **Mismatch between the \u201cRossler domain\u201d and the PDF grid**.  \n   In your `rossler_field(...)`, you do:\n   ```python\n   x, y, z = torch.meshgrid(\n       torch.linspace(-10,15,N),\n       torch.linspace(-30,10,N),\n       torch.linspace(0,30,N)\n   )\n   ```\n   so \\(x\\in[-10,15]\\), \\(y\\in[-30,10]\\), \\(z\\in[0,30]\\).  \n   But in your PDF, you do:\n   ```python\n   x = torch.arange(N)\n   X,Y,Z = torch.meshgrid(x,x,x)\n   mean = [200., 200., 200.]\n   std = 50.\n   p = exp( -0.5*((X-200)^2 + (Y-200)^2 + (Z-200)^2 ) / 50^2 )\n   ```\n   That means your PDF is centered way out at \\((200,200,200)\\), whereas your vector field is only covering \\([-10,15]\\times[-30,10]\\times[0,30]\\).  \n\n   - Numerically, this is a big discrepancy: your velocity field is effectively not defined beyond \\((15,10,30)\\).  \n   - So either you want your domain in the PDF to match the domain in the vector field or you want to do some coordinate transform so that the indexing lines up consistently. Otherwise, you will have a \u201cflow\u201d that\u2019s physically meaningless in the region \\((200,200,200)\\).  \n\n   This mismatch alone can cause weird boundary artifacts because your PDE solver has no meaningful velocity at \u201cthe edges\u201d and might be producing large spurious gradients.\n\n3. **Boundary conditions**.  \n   With no diffusion and no boundary condition enforcement, purely advecting a PDF can cause mass to flow off-grid.  In many PDE codes, that mass just \u201cdisappears\u201d or yields spurious numerical artifacts at the corners.  \n   - In continuous theory, the domain might be all of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  But numerically, you are truncating to a finite box.  Then you either need:\n     - Outflow or absorbing boundaries,\n     - Periodic BC (if physically appropriate),\n     - Or a sufficiently large domain that the flow never meaningfully hits the boundary.\n\n4. **Very small clamping range**.  \n   You do `p.clamp(min=1e-10, max=1e-6)`.  This is quite an aggressive clamp.  If \\(p\\) has truly smaller or bigger values, your clamp will forcibly set them to a *constant* threshold, thereby introducing artificial steps in the distribution and possibly huge artificial gradients near the edges where the clamp is triggered.  \n\n5. **Normalization after each step**.  \n   You do:\n   ```python\n   p = p / (p.sum() + eps)\n   ```\n   after updating \\(p\\).  This means any net \u201closs\u201d or \u201cgain\u201d from boundary flux or from numerical imprecision is undone by a uniform scaling of \\(p\\).  That might re-inject mass into the corners if the corners have not fully decayed to exactly zero and get \u201cscaled up.\u201d  \n\n   - For purely advective flow (no diffusion), in principle the integral of \\(p\\) in the domain should remain constant *if* you have perfectly conservative boundary conditions.  If you do not, then lumps near the boundary or corners can get artificially magnified upon renormalization.\n\nTherefore, from a strictly mathematical standpoint, the equation you need to solve is correct (the continuity equation for a deterministic flow). But the **discretization details** (dimensions, boundary handling, clamping, normalization, etc.) can invalidate the result or cause large artifacts.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Possible reasons for noise/blow-up in the corners & suggested fixes\n\nYou specifically mention that \u201cnoise builds up in the corners and blows up the distribution.\u201d  Here are several common reasons:\n\n1. **Improper derivative along the wrong dimension.**  \n   - As noted, you only used `dim=1` in `torch.gradient(...)`.  You need partial derivatives along **all** relevant dimensions.  Using partial derivatives on only one axis can artificially \u201cdump\u201d mass into corners.\n\n2. **Boundary conditions / no explicit outflow or absorbing BC.**  \n   - If your velocity field tries to flow outward, mass can accumulate on the boundaries.  \n   - If you then renormalize, any small numerical \u201cblip\u201d at the boundary/corner might get scaled up.  Over many time steps, that \u201cblip\u201d can blow up.\n\n3. **The domain is not aligned with your PDF\u2019s coordinate system** (the mismatch between \\([-10,15]\\times[-30,10]\\times[0,30]\\) vs. the \\([0,400]\\times[0,400]\\times[0,400]\\) for the PDF).  \n   - If the system tries to advect the PDF outside the range of the velocity field, your numerical derivatives become nonsense at or beyond the boundary.  \n   - Or the velocity is effectively zero in some huge portion of your domain, letting the corners remain \u201cstale,\u201d and each time-step's renormalization can inflate those stale corners.\n\n4. **Clamping** to a minimum like \\(1e{-10}\\).  \n   - Each time-step, negative or near-zero values in corners get bumped up to \\(1e{-10}\\).  If the overall integral of \\(p\\) is small, that \\(1e{-10}\\) can become a non-negligible fraction\u2014then gets rescaled up via normalization.  \n   - Over many steps, that corner becomes artificially large.\n\n5. **Time-step too large** (CFL condition violations).  \n   - In purely advective problems, the Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy condition typically imposes\n     \\[\n       \\Delta t \\cdot \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_{\\max}}{\\Delta x} \\;\\lesssim\\; 1\n     \\]\n   - If this is violated, one sees \u201cwiggles\u201d or blow-up near boundaries.\n\n6. **No diffusion term** can cause \u201cshocks\u201d or strong gradients if the flow is compressible or if the flow leads to caustics in phase space.  \n   - The Rossler is chaotic in certain regimes; chaotic advection can distort your PDF drastically if there\u2019s zero diffusion and if the finite-grid discretization is not done with a conservative, high-resolution advection scheme.  \n   - Often in practice, a tiny artificial viscosity or diffusion term helps stabilize the solution.\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n- **Correct your divergence code.** Make sure you do:\n  ```python\n  dx = torch.gradient(p * f[..., 0], dim=0)[0]\n  dy = torch.gradient(p * f[..., 1], dim=1)[0]\n  dz = torch.gradient(p * f[..., 2], dim=2)[0]\n  div = dx + dy + dz\n  p = p - dt * div\n  ```\n  rather than using the same `dim=1` for everything.\n\n- **Match the PDF domain to the velocity-field domain** or vice versa.  \n  - If you truly want the domain to be \\([-10,15]\\times[-30,10]\\times[0,30]\\), then define your \\(X,Y,Z\\) grids accordingly.  \n  - If you truly want \\((0, \\dots, N)\\) with \\(\\text{mean}=(200,200,200)\\), then your velocity field also needs to be on that same \\((0,\\dots,400)\\)-ish domain, or you need to transform coordinates consistently.\n\n- **Add suitable boundary conditions** or at least a big enough domain that the PDF never meaningfully sees the edge.  \n  - Alternatively, explicitly set outflow BC or zero flux BC so corners don\u2019t blow up.  \n\n- **Reduce clamping** or remove it.  \n  - If you must clamp negative values, clamp them to something like \\(\\max(p,0)\\) gently, or add a small diffusion term so that you never get physically negative values.  \n  - Hard-clamping to \\((1e{-10}, 1e{-6})\\) can be a big source of artificial boundary layers.\n\n- **Use a smaller time step**.  \n  - Check if you are satisfying a stable CFL condition for your advection.  \n\n- **Consider an upwind or flux-limited method**.  \n  - For advection-dominated PDEs, central differences in finite differences can cause strong oscillations.  More stable schemes (e.g. Godunov\u2019s method, WENO, flux limiters) are often used in practice.\n\n- **Try adding a small diffusion term** \\(\\kappa \\Delta p\\).  \n  - Even if your \u201ctrue\u201d PDE is purely advective, a small numerical diffusion stabilizes the code and can prevent corner blow-up (though it slightly changes the PDE).\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n1. **Is the math correct for deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck?**  \n   - Conceptually, yes: \\(\\partial_t p = - \\nabla \\cdot (p\\,f)\\) is the correct PDE for an ODE flow \\(\\dot{x} = f(x)\\).  \n   - Implementation-wise, you likely need to fix how you compute the 3D divergence (not just along `dim=1`) and ensure the PDF grid lines up with your velocity field.\n\n2. **Why does the distribution blow up in the corners?**  \n   - Common culprits include:  \n     1. Taking derivatives along the wrong axis or incomplete divergence.  \n     2. Mismatch in domain for PDF vs. velocity field.  \n     3. No boundary conditions.  \n     4. Large time step / unstable scheme.  \n     5. Re-normalization plus clamping artificially amplifying corner values.  \n     6. No diffusion + chaotic advection can produce large gradients.  \n\n**Suggested fixes**: match domains, compute the correct 3D divergence, add consistent boundary conditions, consider smaller \\(\\Delta t\\) or a more stable advection scheme, and remove or soften the clamp + re-normalization."

              "Below are some additional suggestions that may help you track down (and hopefully fix) edge blow-ups\u2014even after you\u2019ve correctly computed the 3D divergence (rather than just along `dim=1`)\u2014and some notes on how to properly normalize the PDF so that it represents a real density (with correct units).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Further strategies to tame edge blow-up\n\n### 1.1. Use a *finite-volume* (flux-based) approach rather than naive central differences\n\n- Pure central differencing for an advection/continuity equation can lead to numerical oscillations and blow-up near boundaries\u2014especially if the velocity field is large, chaotic, or not \u201caligned\u201d with your grid.\n- A more robust approach is to treat \\(\\partial_t p = -\\nabla \\cdot (p\\,f)\\) with a **finite-volume** or **flux-based** method (e.g. Godunov, upwind, or a flux limiter scheme). \n  - This ensures numerical conservation of mass (no negative densities) and tends to handle boundaries more gracefully.  \n- If you still want to use `torch.gradient`, consider at least an \u201cupwind\u201d difference scheme or a \u201cWENO\u201d approach. Pure central differences easily blow up for hyperbolic PDEs unless the time step is extremely small (CFL-limited).\n\n### 1.2. Re-check boundary conditions\n\n1. **Zeroing out edges** is typically *not* a real boundary condition for a continuity equation. It often introduces artificial reflections or big jumps at the boundary that can blow up when re-normalized.\n2. More physically consistent boundary conditions for a flow-based PDE might be:\n   - **Outflow** (a.k.a. \u201copen\u201d or \u201cNeumann\u201d) boundary: the distribution can flow out naturally. Numerically, that often means copying the interior value of \\(p\\) into the ghost cells for tangential flow, or setting the derivative in the outward direction to 0, etc.\n   - **Periodic** boundary: if that\u2019s physically relevant (flow that wraps around).\n   - **Absorbing** boundary: if you literally want mass to leave the domain. Then you must accept that total mass in the domain changes over time (which conflicts a bit with your re-normalization to sum=1).\n\nBecause you\u2019re re-normalizing each time step (see Section 2 below), any small amounts of \u201cleftover\u201d density near the boundaries can get disproportionately scaled up. If the boundary is too close or the velocity field pushes mass outward, the PDE solution might become extremely small in the interior, and that near-zero interior is forced to \u201ccompete\u201d with boundary corners that were pinned or clipped at some minimum. Then the corner values blow up upon re-normalization.\n\n### 1.3. Double-check your *time-step size* (the CFL condition)\n\nFor pure advection by velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\equiv f(x)\\), you typically need:\n\\[\n   \\Delta t \\;\\lesssim\\; \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_{\\max}}\n\\]\nin each spatial dimension (\\(\\Delta x\\) might be the grid spacing, or \\(\\min(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z)\\) in 3D). If you pick \\(\\Delta t\\) too large, you can get overshoot or blow-up at the boundaries.\n\n### 1.4. Add a small numerical diffusion or \u201cartificial viscosity\u201d\n\n- If your Rossler flow is strongly mixing and chaotic, purely advecting a sharp (or even moderately peaked) distribution on a finite grid can create big gradients that the solver can\u2019t handle well.\n- Adding a small diffusion term, \\(\\kappa \\Delta p\\), can smooth out high gradients near corners and reduce blow-ups.  \n- This changes the pure Liouville equation into an actual Fokker\u2013Planck equation with diffusion, which might or might not be physically desired\u2014but it\u2019s often very helpful for numerical stability.\n\n### 1.5. Reduce or remove aggressive clamping\n\n- If you clamp the PDF below some small value (`1e-10`) and above some max (`1e-6`), you create discontinuities at the edges or wherever the clamp is triggered. \n- Those discontinuities can produce big gradients, which the PDE update can blow up. \n- If you\u2019re doing a physically consistent finite-volume approach (where fluxes keep \\(p\\ge 0\\)), you shouldn\u2019t need to clamp to a *minimum* anyway. The PDE itself is mass-conserving, so negative or huge values usually come from numerical issues.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How to properly normalize so \\(p\\) is a *density*\n\n### 2.1. Continuous vs. discrete viewpoint\n\nIn the continuous PDE,  \n\\[\n   \\int_{\\Omega} p(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\, d^3x = 1,\n\\]  \nmeaning the total probability over your domain \\(\\Omega\\) is 1.\n\nIn a **discrete** grid with spacing \\(\\Delta x\\), \\(\\Delta y\\), and \\(\\Delta z\\), each cell represents a volume \\(\\Delta V = \\Delta x\\,\\Delta y\\,\\Delta z\\). The discrete version of the integral is:  \n\\[\n   \\sum_{i,j,k} p_{i,j,k} \\,\\Delta V \\;=\\; 1.\n\\]  \nHence the dimension of \\(p_{i,j,k}\\) in the code is \u201c(probability) / (volume)\u201d.\n\n### 2.2. Incorporating \\(\\Delta V\\) in your normalization\n\nIf your grid is *uniform* with \\(\\Delta x=\\Delta y=\\Delta z=h\\), then \\(\\Delta V = h^3\\). Suppose you store in `p` the raw array of cell-centered values. Then to ensure you have total mass = 1, you want:\n\\[\n   \\sum_{i,j,k} p_{i,j,k}\\, h^3 \\;=\\; 1.\n\\]  \nIf you\u2019re ignoring \\(h\\) in your code and simply do `p /= p.sum()`, you are effectively *assuming* \\(h^3 = 1\\). That\u2019s fine if you built your domain so that the grid spacing is 1 in each dimension. But if that\u2019s not the case, you need to do  \n```python\np = p / (p.sum() * h**3)\n```\nfor uniform spacing.\n\nIf your grid is *non*-uniform or if you have a domain from \\([-10,15]\\) etc. with \\(N=400\\) points, the spacing is  \n\\[\n  \\Delta x = \\frac{15 - (-10)}{N - 1} = \\frac{25}{N-1},\n\\]  \n\\[\n  \\Delta y = \\frac{10 - (-30)}{N - 1} = \\frac{40}{N-1},\n\\]  \n\\[\n  \\Delta z = \\frac{30 - 0}{N - 1}  = \\frac{30}{N-1}.\n\\]  \nThen \\(\\Delta V = \\Delta x\\,\\Delta y\\,\\Delta z\\). You\u2019d do  \n```python\nvolume_element = dx * dy * dz\np = p / (p.sum() * volume_element)\n```\nto make sure it sums to 1 *in continuous units*.\n\n### 2.3. When/if to re-normalize every step\n\n- In principle, if your PDE solver is purely advective and you have perfect flux conservation at the boundaries, the total mass \\(\\sum p_{i,j,k} \\Delta V\\) should remain constant (usually 1) *without* re-normalization.\n- In practice, numerical methods cause small mass drift. People often re-normalize periodically (e.g. every few steps) if they want to guarantee the integral is 1. \n- **However**, re-normalizing can artificially inflate spurious values near corners/boundaries. You may prefer to:\n  1. Extend your domain so that outflow doesn\u2019t matter (the mass never truly leaves), or  \n  2. Use a boundary condition that ensures flux is zero crossing the boundary (fully enclosed domain), or  \n  3. Accept that mass leaves the domain, in which case re-normalization is *not* physically correct unless you want \u201call mass that remains in the domain must sum to 1.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Summary of next steps\n\n1. **Implement a more stable advection scheme** (finite-volume or at least an upwind difference) rather than naive central differences.  \n2. **Set physically consistent boundary conditions** (outflow / zero-flux / periodic). Zeroing edges to 0 rarely solves blow-up issues\u2014in fact, it can cause blow-up upon re-normalization.  \n3. **Reduce the time step** to satisfy a stable CFL condition. If the velocity is large or the grid is fine, you may need \\(\\Delta t \\ll 1e{-3}\\).  \n4. **Consider adding small numerical diffusion** (artificial viscosity) if Rossler\u2019s flow is chaotic and your solver grid is too coarse.  \n5. **Remove or soften clamping** that sets a hard floor or ceiling on \\(p\\). It can introduce large jumps that blow up after re-normalization.  \n6. **Properly normalize** your PDF with the volume element. That is:\n   ```python\n   # Suppose you have uniform dx, dy, dz:\n   dx = (xmax - xmin) / (N - 1)\n   dy = (ymax - ymin) / (N - 1)\n   dz = (zmax - zmin) / (N - 1)\n   volume_element = dx * dy * dz\n   p = p / (p.sum() * volume_element)\n   ```\n   or do a finite-volume approach that automatically keeps track of cell volumes.  \n\nWith those adjustments, you should see far fewer corner artifacts or blow-ups. If you still see them, check that your domain is truly big enough for the Rossler flow you want to simulate (so the flow doesn\u2019t push mass too close to the boundary). Good luck!"

              "Yes, that\u2019s entirely possible for a **linear** advection (or Liouville/Fokker\u2013Planck) equation. In such linear PDEs, if \\(p\\) solves\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; -\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl( p\\,f \\bigr)\\,,\n\\]\n\nthen so does \\(\\tilde{p} = c\\,p\\) for any constant \\(c\\). The shape (relative profile) of the solution is exactly the same; it\u2019s just scaled by \\(c\\).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why it works mathematically\n\nBecause the PDE is **linear** in \\(p\\), the operator \n\\[\n  \\mathcal{L}[p] \\;=\\; -\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl( p\\,f \\bigr)\n\\]\nsatisfies\n\\[\n  \\mathcal{L}[c \\, p] \\;=\\; c \\;\\mathcal{L}[p].\n\\]\nThus, if \\(p(t,\\mathbf{x})\\) is a solution, then so is \\(c\\,p(t,\\mathbf{x})\\).  \n\nIn other words, the evolution of \\(p\\) depends only on its relative shape, not on the absolute amplitude\u2014unless you impose a boundary condition or constraint that fixes the integral of \\(p\\).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. When normalization matters\n\n1. **Preserving total mass**:  \n   - In a purely advective (or Liouville) setting with closed boundaries (no flux leaving the domain), the total mass\n     \\[\n       \\int_{\\Omega} p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\,d^3x\n     \\]\n     should remain constant in time (conserved). If you want that constant to be 1 (for a probability distribution), you can choose \\(c\\) at the end so that\n     \\[\n       \\int_{\\Omega} \\tilde{p}(\\mathbf{x},t) \\,d^3x \\;=\\; 1.\n     \\]\n   - But if there is *outflow* across the domain boundary, the total mass in \\(\\Omega\\) can decrease, so you may need to decide whether you want to keep re-normalizing or allow mass to exit.\n\n2. **If you add diffusion** or other nonlinearities:  \n   - A pure deterministic Liouville equation is linear in \\(p\\). But if you add a diffusion term like \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl(D\\,\\nabla p\\bigr)\\), it\u2019s *still* linear in \\(p\\). Scaling by \\(c\\) remains fine.  \n   - If you had *nonlinear* terms (e.g., \\(p^2\\) or a reaction term), then scaling by \\(c\\) would not yield the same shape solution.\n\n3. **Practical concerns**:  \n   - If you let \\(p\\) get extremely large (or extremely small) without normalization, you might run into floating-point issues.  \n   - However, from a purely mathematical standpoint, you can indeed integrate an unnormalized \\(p\\) throughout the simulation and only scale it at the end.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Conclusion\n\n- **Yes**, you can evolve \\(c \\cdot p\\) instead of \\(p\\) and normalize only at the end.  \n- The shape of the distribution will be the same throughout, and the final distribution can then be scaled to integrate to 1 if you desire a probability interpretation.  \n- Just be sure that you\u2019re comfortable with any potential numerical issues (like overflow or underflow) that might arise from never re-scaling \\(p\\) during the simulation."

              "Below is a deeper discussion on what might still be causing your \u201cedge blow-up\u201d problem and some practical fixes. Even though you fixed the dimension issue (i.e., computing the divergence in all 3D directions), there are still several subtle points in advective PDE solvers\u2014especially with large velocities on the boundary.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Why does a large \\(f\\) on the boundary lead to blow-up?\n\n### 1.1) Large velocities + finite difference can violate CFL stability\n\nFor an advection equation \\(\\partial_t p = -\\,\\nabla\\cdot (p\\,f)\\), a classic condition for numerical stability is the **Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy (CFL) condition**. Roughly speaking, in each direction:\n\n\\[\n  \\Delta t \\,\\frac{|\\,f_{\\max}\\,|}{\\Delta x} \\;\\lesssim\\; 1.\n\\]\n\n- If \\(f\\) (the velocity vector) is very large near domain edges, mass can \u201cmove\u201d by large amounts in each time step.  \n- With a naive central-difference approximation for \\(\\nabla\\cdot(p\\,f)\\), you can easily get negative (or exploding) densities if the CFL condition is violated.  \n\n**Possible fix**:  \n- **Decrease** \\(\\Delta t\\) if you can (make it smaller).  \n- Or use an **adaptive** \\(\\Delta t\\) that scales with the local velocity magnitude \\(\\|f\\|\\).  \n\n### 1.2) Missing boundary conditions (\u201cmass piling up\u201d)\n\n- If your domain is finite and you do not have an absorbing/outflow boundary condition, then all the \u201cflow\u201d near the boundary might keep \u201creflecting\u201d (depending on how the finite difference handles it) or artificially staying in the domain, causing accumulation or blow-up.  \n- Or, if you renormalize the PDF and anything in the corners remains slightly > 0, it might get amplified every time-step.\n\n**Possible fix**:  \n- Impose an **outflow** or **absorbing** boundary condition (e.g. set \\(p=0\\) or zero gradient at the boundary, or let mass exit the domain).  \n- Make the domain large enough that the flow does not meaningfully hit the boundary in the time frame of interest.\n\n### 1.3) Numerical scheme for the divergence\n\nYou mentioned wondering if you should use the product rule explicitly, i.e.  \n\\[\n  \\nabla \\cdot (f \\, p) \\;=\\; p\\,(\\nabla \\cdot f) \\;+\\; f \\cdot (\\nabla p).\n\\]\n\n- **In principle**, numerically,  \n  \\[\n    \\nabla\\cdot(f\\,p)  \n    \\;\\approx\\; \\partial_x(f_x\\,p) \\,+\\, \\partial_y(f_y\\,p) \\,+\\, \\partial_z(f_z\\,p)\n  \\]\n  should be **equivalent** to  \n  \\[\n    p\\,(\\nabla\\cdot f) \\;+\\; f\\cdot\\nabla p\n  \\]\n  if you compute it carefully with consistent finite differences.  \n- If you already have \\(f\\) tabulated on the same grid, computing \\(\\nabla \\cdot f\\) might be no more stable or unstable than computing \\(\\nabla (p\\,f)\\). It can help if \\(f\\) has a known analytical expression so that \\(\\nabla \\cdot f\\) is known exactly, but that alone does not necessarily fix boundary blow-up if your numeric advection scheme is still central difference or not stabilized.\n\n### 1.4) Compressibility & upwind schemes\n\nIf the flow \\(\\nabla\\cdot f\\) is large and positive in some region, you can get local expansions that spread out \\(p\\). If \\(\\nabla\\cdot f\\) is large and negative, you can get local compressions of \\(p\\). This can create steep gradients that are hard to handle with central-difference methods.  \n\n**Possible fix**:  \n- Use an **upwind method** (or flux limiter, Godunov method, WENO, etc.) so that the solution respects the direction of flow. Standard central differences can produce oscillations or blow-ups when the velocity is large.  \n\n### 1.5) Tiny clamp range & renormalization\n\nRecall that in your code snippet, you have:\n\n```python\np = p.clamp(min=1e-10, max=1e-6) \np = p / (p.sum() + eps)\n```\n\nAny time there are small corner values that get clamped to `1e-10`, the subsequent renormalization can artificially boost them if the total mass is small. Over many steps, a small \u201cblip\u201d in the corners can get amplified.  \n\n**Possible fix**:  \n- Avoid (or reduce) heavy clamping. If you must clamp, do it only for negative values (e.g., clamp to 0 if your scheme produces negative densities).  \n- Make sure your time-step is small enough that your solver does **not** produce huge negative or positive spikes that need clamping in the first place.  \n- A small, controlled diffusion term or smoothing can also keep \\(p\\) from becoming negative.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Should you expand the divergence with the product rule explicitly?\n\nExpanding \\(\\nabla \\cdot (p\\,f)\\) using the product rule:\n\n\\[\n  \\nabla \\cdot (p \\, f)\n  \\;=\\;\n  p \\,(\\nabla \\cdot f)\n  \\;+\\; f \\cdot (\\nabla p)\n\\]\n\n**In principle**, whether you do:\n\n```python\ndiv_fp = torch.gradient(p * f[...,0], dim=0)[0]\n       + torch.gradient(p * f[...,1], dim=1)[0]\n       + torch.gradient(p * f[...,2], dim=2)[0]\n```\n\nor do:\n\n```python\np_times_div_f = p * (torch.gradient(f[...,0], dim=0)[0]\n                   + torch.gradient(f[...,1], dim=1)[0]\n                   + torch.gradient(f[...,2], dim=2)[0])\nf_dot_grad_p = (f[...,0] * torch.gradient(p, dim=0)[0]\n              + f[...,1] * torch.gradient(p, dim=1)[0]\n              + f[...,2] * torch.gradient(p, dim=2)[0])\ndiv_fp_alt = p_times_div_f + f_dot_grad_p\n```\n\nthey should be numerically **similar** if all partial derivatives are done consistently and if your boundary conditions are the same. \n\nBut sometimes, if \\(f\\) is analytically known, you can compute \\(\\nabla \\cdot f\\) exactly and reduce numerical errors. Also, some PDE solvers prefer `p * div(f) + f\u00b7grad(p)` for certain boundary conditions or if it\u2019s easier to code upwind flux for `f\u00b7grad(p)`.  \n\nSo, using the product rule **by itself** won\u2019t automatically cure boundary blow-up. The real issues are typically:\n\n1. Time-step size (CFL stability),  \n2. Boundary conditions (allowing outflow vs. artificially reflecting mass),  \n3. Choice of numerical advection scheme (upwind vs. central difference),  \n4. Aggressive clamping/renormalizing.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Additional ideas to mitigate edge blow-up\n\n1. **Smaller time-step \\(\\Delta t\\)**  \n   - If \\(f_{\\max}\\) is large, you must reduce \\(\\Delta t\\).  \n   - Even a factor of 10 smaller can help with stability significantly.\n\n2. **Explicit flux-based or upwind scheme**  \n   - Central difference is \u201csecond-order accurate\u201d in a smooth scenario, but can be unstable with sharp gradients or large velocity.  \n   - An upwind scheme uses the sign of each velocity component to decide which neighbor\u2019s values to take, preventing unphysical negative or blow-ups.  \n\n3. **Add a small diffusion/viscosity**  \n   - Physically, pure advection can create steep gradients or singularities in chaotic systems.  \n   - A \u201cvanishing viscosity\u201d approach\u2014adding a small \\(\\kappa \\Delta p\\) term\u2014often makes solutions more stable at the boundary.\n\n4. **Extend your domain**  \n   - If you see big velocities near the edges, maybe your domain isn\u2019t large enough to \u201ccontain\u201d the flow region of interest. Let mass flow out more naturally instead of \u201cpiling up.\u201d  \n\n5. **Impose boundary conditions**  \n   - For instance, outflow boundaries: when velocity points out of the domain, let the PDF exit. If velocity points in, you can set incoming density to zero or match some known distribution.  \n\n6. **Avoid strong clamp + renormalization**  \n   - If you need to keep total mass at 1, you can do so less frequently or carefully treat boundary flux.  \n   - Large clamp + forceful renormalization can create artificial lumps at the corners.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- **Yes**, you can rewrite \\(\\nabla\\cdot(p\\,f)\\) via product rule, but that alone is unlikely to fix large-velocity blow-up at boundaries.  \n- The most common fix is to **use a stable advection scheme** (upwind / flux limiter) with a **suitably small time-step** that meets CFL.  \n- Also pay special attention to **boundary conditions** if the velocity near the edges is large.  \n- A small artificial diffusion or a domain extension can also help prevent blow-ups."
