              "The relationship between the Schr\u00f6dinger equation's continuity equation (which describes the evolution of \\(|\\psi|^2\\)) and the Fokker-Planck equation lies in how both describe the time evolution of a probability density, but with different underlying dynamics.\n\n### Schr\u00f6dinger Equation, Continuity Equation, and Probability Evolution\n\n- The Schr\u00f6dinger equation governs the evolution of the quantum wavefunction \\(\\psi\\), and the corresponding probability density \\(|\\psi|^2\\) evolves according to the **continuity equation**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|\\psi|^2 = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j},\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\mathbf{j} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m} \\, \\mathrm{Im}[\\psi^* \\nabla \\psi]\\) is the probability current.\n  \n- This framework is deterministic for the evolution of the quantum probability density, but it arises from the wave-like, non-classical behavior of quantum systems. There is no explicit stochastic process here; instead, the evolution is determined by the Hamiltonian.\n\n---\n\n### Fokker-Planck Equation and Stochastic Dynamics\n\n- The **Fokker-Planck equation** describes the deterministic evolution of a probability density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) in the context of stochastic systems, such as particles undergoing Brownian motion. Its general form is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\rho) + \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla \\rho),\n  \\]\n  where:\n  - \\(\\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) is the drift vector, representing deterministic forces.\n  - \\(D(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) is the diffusion coefficient, representing stochastic effects.\n\n- The Fokker-Planck equation is the deterministic counterpart to a **stochastic differential equation** (SDE), such as the Langevin equation, which describes individual trajectories of particles in random environments. Here, randomness in the SDE translates into probabilistic spread in \\(\\rho\\), captured by \\(D\\).\n\n---\n\n### Key Relationship Between the Two\n\n1. **Both Govern Probability Densities**:\n   - In both the Schr\u00f6dinger continuity equation and the Fokker-Planck equation, the quantity evolving over time is a probability density (\\(|\\psi|^2\\) in quantum mechanics and \\(\\rho\\) in stochastic dynamics).\n\n2. **Deterministic Evolution**:\n   - The continuity equation for \\(|\\psi|^2\\) is deterministic and arises directly from the deterministic Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n   - The Fokker-Planck equation is also deterministic but reflects the statistical effects of an ensemble of stochastic processes (e.g., Langevin trajectories).\n\n3. **Role of Drift and Current**:\n   - The **quantum probability current** \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) in the Schr\u00f6dinger continuity equation plays a role analogous to the **drift term** \\(\\mathbf{b}\\rho\\) in the Fokker-Planck equation. In both cases, this term governs how probability density flows in space.\n\n4. **Diffusion vs. Interference**:\n   - In the Fokker-Planck equation, diffusion terms (\\(D \\nabla^2 \\rho\\)) arise from stochastic processes, causing a spreading of the density.\n   - In quantum mechanics, there is no diffusion term in the continuity equation; instead, the evolution of \\(|\\psi|^2\\) is influenced by interference effects arising from the wavefunction's phase.\n\n---\n\n### Connecting the Two in Contexts\n\nIn certain limits, quantum dynamics can resemble stochastic dynamics, allowing the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to connect with the Fokker-Planck equation:\n\n1. **Semiclassical Limit**:\n   - In the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics, the wavefunction phase dominates, and \\(|\\psi|^2\\) may resemble a probability density in a classical stochastic system. Here, quantum interference diminishes, and \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) can resemble drift in a Fokker-Planck-like framework.\n\n2. **Quantum-Classical Correspondence**:\n   - For open quantum systems, interaction with an environment introduces decoherence, effectively randomizing the wavefunction phases. This can lead to dynamics where \\(|\\psi|^2\\) behaves according to a Fokker-Planck equation.\n\n3. **Stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger Equations**:\n   - In certain interpretations (e.g., Bohmian mechanics or stochastic collapse theories), the evolution of quantum systems can explicitly involve stochastic dynamics. In such cases, the resulting probability densities may satisfy equations akin to the Fokker-Planck equation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The Schr\u00f6dinger equation's continuity equation and the Fokker-Planck equation both describe how probability densities evolve over time.\n- The Schr\u00f6dinger equation introduces a deterministic current (via \\(\\mathbf{j}\\)) tied to quantum interference, while the Fokker-Planck equation includes diffusion (via \\(D\\)) tied to stochastic effects.\n- In the semiclassical or open quantum system limits, quantum dynamics can reduce to forms that resemble the Fokker-Planck equation, bridging the two frameworks."

              "Quantum Field Theory (QFT) does not have a single universally accepted \u201caxiomatic\u201d formulation in the same way that, for example, Euclidean geometry does. Instead, there are several approaches\u2014each proposing a rigorous foundation by listing assumptions (or \u201caxioms\u201d) and deriving physical consequences from them. The three most notable frameworks are:\n\n1. **Wightman Axioms (Hilbert Space Approach)**  \n2. **Haag\u2013Kastler Axioms (Algebraic QFT)**  \n3. **Osterwalder\u2013Schrader Axioms (Euclidean Field Theory)**\n\nBelow is a brief summary of each.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Wightman Axioms\nThe Wightman axioms (developed mainly by Arthur Wightman in the 1950s\u20131960s) propose a rigorous operator-theoretic setting in Minkowski spacetime. They assume:\n\n1. **Hilbert Space of States**  \n   - There is a separable Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) on which quantum fields act.\n   \n2. **Field Operators as Operator-Valued Distributions**  \n   - Physical fields \\(\\phi(x)\\) are not strictly functions at each point \\(x\\in \\mathbb{R}^4\\).  \n   - Instead, they are **operator-valued distributions**, meaning that to make mathematical sense, you smear them with test functions before applying them to states.\n\n3. **Covariance under the Poincar\u00e9 Group**  \n   - There is a (strongly continuous) unitary representation \\(U\\) of the Poincar\u00e9 group on \\(\\mathcal{H}\\).  \n   - Under a Poincar\u00e9 transformation \\(a,\\Lambda\\), fields transform in a prescribed manner, e.g.  \n     \\[\n       U(a,\\Lambda)\\,\\phi(x)\\,U(a,\\Lambda)^{-1} \\;=\\; \\phi(\\Lambda x + a).\n     \\]\n\n4. **Spectrum Condition (Positivity of Energy)**  \n   - The joint energy-momentum operator (the four-momentum) has its spectrum contained in the future light cone (i.e., energies are nonnegative in the rest frame).\n\n5. **Existence and Uniqueness of the Vacuum**  \n   - There is a unique (up to a phase) vacuum state \\(\\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) in \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) which is invariant under the Poincar\u00e9 group.\n\n6. **Local (Micro-)Causality**  \n   - Field operators associated with spacelike-separated regions commute (for bosonic fields) or anticommute (for fermionic fields).  \n   - Symbolically, if \\( (x - y)^2 < 0 \\) (spacelike separation), then  \n     \\[\n       [\\phi(x), \\phi(y)] = 0 \\quad \\text{(for bosons)}.\n     \\]\n\nThese axioms were historically central in showing how one can rigorously construct correlation functions (Wightman functions) and connect them to scattering processes.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Haag\u2013Kastler Axioms (Algebraic QFT)\nThe algebraic (or \u201clocal\u201d) QFT approach, due primarily to Rudolf Haag and Daniel Kastler in the 1960s, shifts the perspective from fields to **nets of local observables**. Rather than postulating fields \\(\\phi(x)\\), one postulates algebras of observables \\(\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})\\) associated with each spacetime region \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). The core axioms here include:\n\n1. **Isotony**  \n   - If \\(\\mathcal{O}_1 \\subset \\mathcal{O}_2\\), then \\(\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O}_1) \\subset \\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O}_2)\\).  \n   - Larger regions contain more observables.\n\n2. **Locality (Einstein Causality)**  \n   - If \\(\\mathcal{O}_1\\) and \\(\\mathcal{O}_2\\) are spacelike separated, then the respective algebras commute:  \n     \\[\n       [ \\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O}_1), \\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O}_2) ] = 0.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Covariance**  \n   - There is a representation of the spacetime symmetry group (usually the Poincar\u00e9 group) by automorphisms of the net of algebras.\n\n4. **Spectrum Condition**  \n   - The generator of translations (interpreted as the total 4-momentum operator) has a spectrum in the forward light cone.\n\n5. **Existence of a Vacuum State**  \n   - There is a vacuum vector in the Hilbert space (unique up to phase), which is invariant under the symmetry group.\n\nOne advantage of the algebraic approach is that it clarifies structural questions (e.g., how to handle extensions of QFT to curved spacetimes or to more general settings). But it does not always make explicit how to construct the fields themselves\u2014fields can then be introduced as particular operators affiliated with these local algebras.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Osterwalder\u2013Schrader Axioms (Euclidean Approach)\nThe Osterwalder\u2013Schrader axioms (1970s) provide a path toward constructing QFT via **Euclidean functional integrals**. Instead of working directly in Minkowski spacetime with Lorentzian signature, one performs a Wick rotation \\( t \\mapsto -i\\tau \\) to pass to Euclidean signature. Then one seeks a **Euclidean field theory** whose correlation functions (the Schwinger functions) satisfy certain conditions that ensure they can be analytically continued back to Minkowski space to yield a proper QFT. Key requirements include:\n\n1. **Reflection Positivity**  \n   - A positivity condition that ensures the Euclidean correlators, when \u201crotated back\u201d to real time, become physically valid Minkowski correlation functions.\n\n2. **Euclidean Covariance**  \n   - Under the Euclidean group (rotations + translations in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\)), the Schwinger functions transform covariantly.\n\n3. **Regularity/Temperedness**  \n   - Schwinger functions must not grow faster than certain bounds when positions go to infinity, ensuring well-defined Fourier transforms (related to the spectral condition).\n\n4. **Analytic Continuation**  \n   - One can analytically continue the Euclidean correlation functions to complex time variables. Their boundary values on the real axis then give the Minkowski correlation functions.\n\nThe Euclidean approach is often convenient for nonperturbative studies (e.g., lattice QFT), because the Euclidean path integral behaves more like a standard statistical-mechanics partition function. Proving that a Euclidean theory satisfies Osterwalder\u2013Schrader axioms (and hence corresponds to a full QFT) is generally still quite challenging.\n\n---\n\n## Practical vs. Axiomatic QFT\nIn actual particle-physics calculations, physicists usually rely on **Lagrangians, Feynman diagrams, and renormalization** rather than a full-blown axiomatic construction. However, the above frameworks guide how to make the theory mathematically rigorous and how to check fundamental consistency requirements (like causality, unitarity, and stability).\n\nIn summary, **there is no single list of \u201cthe axioms of QFT.\u201d** Instead, there are multiple overlapping axiomatic programs (Wightman, Haag\u2013Kastler, Osterwalder\u2013Schrader, and others) that impose structure, locality, positivity of energy, and the existence of a vacuum in slightly different but compatible ways. Each provides an avenue for making QFT more mathematically precise\u2014and each continues to inspire research on the foundations of quantum field theory."

I mean, I get everything that you said, but then I want to just say there are different branches of the wave function where there's a good semi-classical approximation and general relativity works pretty well.\n1:28:22.7 DD: So when I say that the theory is false, I mean that it's not true. I mean, I'm using the words true and false in the sense in which they're used in logic, there is no excluded middle.\n1:28:34.2 SC: Sure.\n1:28:35.6 DD: Certainly, both relativity and quantum theory are extremely good approximations in the situations where we want to apply them. It's not so clear that we won't very soon be applying them in other situations, like in the early universe, where we want to explain something like the distribution of microwave background radiation over the sky where there are, where billions of light years involved, and this is all due to something that happened on a scale smaller than an an atomic nucleus originally, where definitely quantum effects were dominant, and we don't know what those were and how they affected gravity and dark matter and spacetime and so on.\n1:29:36.2 DD: So how close a theory is, how good an approximation is, depends on how you want to use it, how good an approximation of theory is. So, yes, certainly, good approximations for practical purposes, but so is Newton's theory. That's also false.\n1:29:56.7 SC: Do you have any hints as to how to modify quantum theory to make it better?\n1:30:03.4 DD: Yes, I think so. So there I would have to go to quantum field theory, which has more of an internal problem. Never mind gravity, just the problem of quantum field theory. All existing quantum field theories are based on axioms which include the axiom that fields that are space-like separated commute with each other. That also means that a field at one point commutes with the future light cone of the field at the other point. And the difference between, but on the other hand, field quantities at the same point fail to commute.\n1:30:54.9 DD: Therefore field quantities are discontinuous everywhere. So the whole conceptual framework of quantum field theory is not what it's cracked up to be. Mathematicians say, okay, well, it's not a field of, it's not a real valued field. It's not a quaternion valued field, it's, I've forgotten what they call it, but anyway, the only things that are real are the integrals of the field over finite size.\n1:31:34.6 SC: Right. Distribution value fields.\n1:31:36.6 DD: Distribution... That's what they're called. Yes. Distribution value fields. So, but that hasn't got a conceptual model. I mean, you can't have a distribution over things that don't exist. So you can say that only the distributions exist, but there's got to be, a distribution has to be over something. And so anyway, in short, I have an idea for a variant of quantum field theory where we don't have that axiom, where fields at space-like separated points are allowed to fail to commute and where the thing that they have to do is be continuous. And there's quite a nice theory, again, mathematically it's quite nice, but conceptually it's wild. I rather like it.\n1:32:37.2 SC: For that reason.\n1:32:38.5 DD: Yes. Yes. So not only do causality and that kind of thing mean a different thing in that theory, but measurement does as well. And the separation of systems into subsystems means something else than it does in ordinary quantum theory. And so I've been trying to get that theory to work for years, and I got some nice equations of motion for it, which I don't know what they mean, but it's rather a nice thing. So because of this pathology in quantum field theory, it's been taken for granted that the way you judge proposed quantum field theories is by how well they let you get round those pathologies, whether you have an infinity that cancels another infinity, and so this discontinuity is not as bad as you might think and so on, and on the other hand, the ones that don't have that property are not really considered.\n\n\n\nWhat does he mean?\n\n "

              "First, let me restate the point David Deutsch is making in that conversation: **he\u2019s pointing out that in standard quantum field theory (QFT), \u201cfields\u201d are not really continuous classical fields**. Instead, they are what mathematicians call *operator-valued distributions*\u2014something much more subtle than an honest-to-goodness function \\(\\phi(x)\\) existing at every point \\(x\\in \\mathbb{R}^4\\).\n\nBelow is an unpacking of Deutsch\u2019s remarks and why he says that leads to \u201cdiscontinuities\u201d and other conceptual issues.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Fields as Operator-Valued Distributions\n\nIn an ordinary classical field theory (say, classical electromagnetism), you have a field \\(E(x)\\) that assigns a definite value (like the electric field strength) to each point \\(x\\). You can talk about continuity in the usual sense: if you move \\(x\\) slightly, \\(E(x)\\) changes only a little, so the field is smooth or continuous.\n\nIn **quantum** field theory, things work differently:\n1. The \u201cfield\u201d \\(\\phi(x)\\) is really an *operator* acting on a Hilbert space.\n2. Even more precisely, \\(\\phi(\\,\\cdot\\,)\\) is an *operator-valued distribution*. This means \\(\\phi(x)\\) at a single point \\(x\\) doesn\u2019t exist as a well-defined operator you can physically measure. You only get a well-defined operator when you *smear* \\(\\phi\\) with a test function \\(f\\) spread out over a finite region, creating something like\n   \\[\n     \\phi(f) \\;=\\; \\int d^4x \\,\\phi(x)\\,f(x).\n   \\]\n3. Because of ultraviolet (short-distance) singularities, quantum fields become *infinite* (or undefined) when you try to evaluate them *pointwise*. The rigorous fix is to treat them as distributions.\n\nFrom a purely mathematical standpoint, distributions are not the same as normal functions; they can be extremely \u201csingular.\u201d Physically, this means there is no direct sense in which the quantum field has a definite value at each point. Deutsch objects that this is not a \u201ctrue field\u201d in the classical sense, and that there\u2019s something conceptually incomplete or \u201cdiscontinuous\u201d about it.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Commutation at Spacelike Separation\n\nQFT also has a requirement of *local (micro-)causality* or *Einstein causality*, which says:\n\\[\n  [\\phi(x), \\phi(y)] = 0 \\quad \\text{whenever } (x - y)^2 < 0,\n\\]\nmeaning the operators (for bosonic fields) commute if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are *spacelike separated*. Roughly, this encodes the idea that no signal or \u201cinfluence\u201d can travel faster than light.\n\nBut at the *same* point (or very close points),\n\\[\n  [\\phi(x), \\phi(y)] \\neq 0 \\quad \\text{(if } x \\approx y),\n\\]\nwhich means the field operators *fail to commute* in timelike or null-separated regions\u2014crucial for capturing quantum effects.\n\nDeutsch notes that from the vantage point of a classical \u201ccontinuous\u201d field, you\u2019d think the field at nearby points can\u2019t abruptly jump from commuting to not-commuting. But in QFT, that abrupt change happens, in a sense, *everywhere*, precisely because the field is not a classical function but an operator distribution. Hence, he says the standard approach suggests \u201cthe field is discontinuous everywhere.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 3. Deutsch\u2019s Critique and Proposed Alternative\n\nDeutsch finds the usual distribution-valued viewpoint unsatisfying. He wants a theory in which:\n- The fields might genuinely take values at each point (i.e., something \u201ccontinuous\u201d in the old classical sense), **but** \n- The requirement that spacelike-separated operators must commute might be weakened or modified.\n\nHe sketches a QFT-like framework where fields remain continuous in spacetime, but you lose (or alter) the usual rule that spacelike operators commute. This, in his words, is \u201cconceptually wild,\u201d because it changes notions of causality, measurement, and subsystem separation\u2014but he thinks it might be more coherent than the standard distribution-based QFT. (He makes it clear he hasn\u2019t fully solved how to make this work; it\u2019s more an ongoing line of thought.)\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Broader Context\n\n1. **Mathematical consistency vs. physical intuition:** Standard QFT is *extremely* successful phenomenologically (it predicts experiments to staggering precision). Mathematically, it\u2019s also quite consistent as an effective theory (especially when treated via the renormalization framework). However, at a deep philosophical or \u201cfoundational\u201d level, the notion of a \u201cfield\u201d as an infinite set of operators at every point looks suspicious.\n\n2. **Distribution-valued fields:** This is not just a quirk of sloppy physics. In the rigorous (Wightman or Haag\u2013Kastler) approaches, fields are indeed distribution-valued. *That* is the standard fix to the \u201cinfinite fluctuations at a point\u201d problem, and it *works* well for practical QFT.\n\n3. **Deutsch\u2019s motivation:** Deutsch is interested in the *conceptual underpinnings* of quantum theory, especially how it might be reconciled or replaced by a deeper framework that includes gravity. His dissatisfaction with distribution-valued fields is partly that it\u2019s \u201cpiecemeal\u201d (fields at a point don\u2019t really exist, so you have to smear them out, etc.). He is exploring whether there\u2019s a deeper, simpler underlying formulation that might unify quantum theory with general relativity.\n\n---\n\n## Short Answer: \u201cWhat does Deutsch Mean?\u201d\n\n- **He\u2019s highlighting that standard QFT fields aren\u2019t truly continuous fields in the classical sense.** Instead, they\u2019re *operator-valued distributions*; you can\u2019t even talk about \u201c\\(\\phi\\) at one point\u201d in a physically measurable way.  \n- The usual *local commutativity* axiom enforces that operators at spacelike separations must commute, but not at the same or nearly the same points\u2014leading to a kind of \u201cdiscontinuity everywhere\u201d from the classical viewpoint.  \n- Deutsch thinks that\u2019s a conceptual mismatch if you want to talk about fields as actual physical entities living at each point. So he\u2019s imagining new frameworks (i.e., relaxing that commutation axiom) that let fields be truly continuous but then require rethinking standard causality and measurement rules.\n\nIn the end, this is Deutsch\u2019s philosophical and theoretical stance on where QFT might need to change\u2014especially once we bring gravity into the picture. But it\u2019s not standard consensus; most physicists accept operator-valued distributions as the correct, if subtle, mathematical basis for QFT."

              "Below is a perspective on why David Deutsch might \u201cfixate\u201d on the discontinuity issue in QFT, and why others might view it less as a problem and more as a clue pointing toward deeper structure.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Deutsch\u2019s Foundational Focus\n\n**David Deutsch is a foundational thinker**\u2014he\u2019s not merely interested in whether quantum field theory (QFT) produces accurate predictions (which it does); he\u2019s trying to understand the *ontology* of the theory. In particular, he wants to know: *What really exists in physical reality?*  \n\n- If fields are *truly fundamental*, he wants them to have well-defined values at each point in spacetime\u2014he wants a continuous entity that \u201creally lives\u201d at each point.  \n- Standard QFT says fields do *not* exist in that straightforward, pointwise manner; they\u2019re operator-valued distributions. Mathematically, that works fine, but it can feel conceptually incomplete if your goal is a deeper \u201cmechanical\u201d picture of how reality is stitched together.\n\nIn short, **Deutsch\u2019s dissatisfaction** reflects a quest for a *fully coherent ontology* that might dovetail neatly with how general relativity treats spacetime as a continuous geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 2. \u201cFeature or Bug?\u201d: Why Others Don\u2019t See It as a Problem\n\n### (a) Successful Predictions & Internal Consistency\n\nMost quantum field theorists see *no contradiction* or internal inconsistency in the distribution-valued nature of fields:\n\n- This structure is *exactly* what you need to handle infinities (ultraviolet divergences) and to preserve causality and unitarity in a rigorous way.  \n- The Wightman, Haag\u2013Kastler, and Osterwalder\u2013Schrader axiomatic formulations *all* rely on operator-valued distributions; they are consistent frameworks that match real-world experiments to astonishing precision.\n\nHence, **for most practitioners, the \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d or distribution aspect is not a bug**\u2014it\u2019s a *feature* telling us that pointlike events in a quantum world are inherently singular.\n\n### (b) Hints of Underlying Quantum Geometry\n\nThere\u2019s"
