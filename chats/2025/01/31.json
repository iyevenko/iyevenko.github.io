If at the end of the day, the only observables are probabilities, what is the most ituitive way to understand why quantum mechanics cannot be written as simply the evolution of a density? What is the missing of information? Is there a better way to describe it than the abstract notion of phase?"

              "The key difference is that classical probability evolution\u2014like that described by the Liouville equation\u2014deals with real, non-negative probabilities that simply \u201cflow\u201d in phase space, without any mechanism for interference. In contrast, quantum mechanics works with complex amplitudes. Although the square of an amplitude\u2019s modulus gives you a probability, the amplitude itself carries extra information in the form of a phase.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Nature of the Mathematical Objects**:  \n   - *Classical Theory*: You have a probability density function that evolves deterministically. The Liouville equation tells you how these probabilities move and spread over phase space.\n   - *Quantum Mechanics*: The state is described by a wavefunction (or state vector) that is complex. This means each state comes with both a magnitude (whose square gives the probability) and a phase.\n\n2. **Interference and Superposition**:  \n   - In quantum mechanics, when you combine states, you add their complex amplitudes. The relative phase between these amplitudes determines whether they interfere constructively or destructively. This interference can dramatically alter the final probability distribution.\n   - A classical probability density has no such interference; adding two probability distributions just yields another distribution, with no extra \u201cmixing\u201d effects.\n\n3. **Density Matrix and Coherence**:  \n   - Even when using the density matrix formalism in quantum mechanics (which might seem analogous to a probability density), the full description includes off-diagonal elements. These elements represent coherences\u2014the phase relationships between different states.\n   - If you were to describe the system only in terms of the diagonal elements (the classical probabilities), you\u2019d lose all the phase information and, with it, the interference phenomena that are quintessentially quantum.\n\n4. **Intuitive Picture**:  \n   Think of it like waves:  \n   - A classical probability distribution is like a simple height map\u2014there\u2019s no notion of wave interference.\n   - A quantum state is like a complex wave: both the height (amplitude) and the timing/position of the crests (phase) matter. Just as two water waves can combine to create unexpected patterns depending on their relative timing (phase), quantum states interfere based on the relative phase of their amplitudes.\n\nSo, while ultimately measurements yield probabilities, the evolution of these probabilities in quantum mechanics is governed by the underlying complex amplitudes whose phase relations are essential for phenomena like interference. The \u201cmissing\u201d piece\u2014when you try to describe quantum mechanics solely as an evolution of a probability density\u2014is precisely this phase information, which encodes the coherence and interference effects that have no counterpart in classical probability theory."

              "It might help to think of phase not as a mysterious extra quantity, but rather as a way of encoding the \u201ctiming\u201d or \u201calignment\u201d of oscillations in a system. Here are some analogies and perspectives that might make it feel less abstract:\n\n1. **Waves and Interference**:  \n   Imagine two waves on the surface of a pond. Each wave has a crest and a trough, and the key to whether they add up to a larger crest (constructive interference) or cancel out (destructive interference) is how \u201cin sync\u201d they are. That \u201cin sync\u201d quality is determined by their phase.  \n   - **Think of phase as an angle or a point in a cycle**: If you imagine a circle representing a full oscillation (0 to 360 degrees), the phase tells you where on that circle a wave is at a given moment. When two waves line up their \u201cangles\u201d (their phases match), they add together.\n\n2. **Clock Analogy**:  \n   Consider two clocks ticking. If both clocks strike the hour exactly at the same time, they are \u201cin phase.\u201d If one clock is a few seconds ahead or behind, they are \u201cout of phase.\u201d Even if each clock tells time perfectly, the relative offset between them is crucial if you\u2019re trying to coordinate an action (like two people clapping in unison). In quantum mechanics, the phase is like that offset\u2014it determines how different parts of a quantum state add together or cancel out.\n\n3. **Vectors in a Plane**:  \n   Quantum amplitudes can be thought of as arrows (vectors) in a plane. The length of each arrow corresponds to the probability amplitude (which, when squared, gives a probability), and the direction of the arrow represents the phase. When you add two vectors, their directions (phases) determine the result. Even if two vectors have the same length, if they point in different directions, their sum can be larger, smaller, or even zero.  \n   - **The phase here is the direction**: It\u2019s the extra piece of information that tells you how these vectors (or amplitudes) combine.\n\n4. **Information Beyond Probabilities**:  \n   In a classical probability distribution, you only have a \u201cweight\u201d at each point\u2014like having a pile of sand with varying amounts at different spots. In quantum mechanics, however, you have a \u201cpile\u201d that not only has weight but also a direction (phase). This direction determines how the \u201cpiles\u201d from different spots can interact when you combine them, leading to interference patterns that simply don\u2019t appear in classical probabilities.\n\nIn summary, while \u201cphase\u201d is the common term, you can think of it as a kind of \u201calignment\u201d or \u201ctiming\u201d information embedded in the wave-like nature of quantum objects. It\u2019s the ingredient that tells you how different parts of a system \u201ctalk\u201d to each other through interference, and that\u2019s why quantum mechanics behaves so differently from classical probability theory\u2014even if, at the end of the day, we only ever observe the outcomes (the probabilities) and not the underlying phase directly."

              "The key point is that while Fourier transforms provide a one\u2010to\u2010one mapping between real and complex descriptions in linear systems (such as representing a pendulum\u2019s motion either in time or frequency domain), quantum mechanics isn\u2019t just a change of representation\u2014it\u2019s a fundamentally different kind of theory where the complex structure isn\u2019t merely a calculational convenience but is tied to its core physical predictions.\n\nHere\u2019s a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Linear versus Nonlinear Structure**:  \n   In the Fourier transform, you\u2019re performing a linear transformation between two equivalent descriptions of the same linear dynamics. No new physics is introduced; you\u2019re simply shifting perspective. In quantum mechanics, however, the complex amplitudes are not just a byproduct of a transformation from a real representation. They appear because the state space is a complex Hilbert space, and the evolution (via the Schr\u00f6dinger equation) is inherently complex and linear. This linearity in the complex domain enables phenomena like interference, but if you tried to represent the same dynamics with purely real numbers, you\u2019d have to double the number of degrees of freedom (typically separating into real and imaginary parts) and you wouldn\u2019t capture the same symmetry structure (e.g., the U(1) phase symmetry).\n\n2. **Projective Structure and Interference**:  \n   The probabilities in quantum mechanics come from the modulus squared of complex amplitudes, but these amplitudes live in a space where the overall phase is unobservable. This leads to a projective Hilbert space where two vectors differing by an overall phase represent the same physical state. That structure is essential for interference phenomena. In a real-valued theory, even if you had an equivalent doubling of variables, the interference effects wouldn\u2019t naturally appear unless you imposed additional, often nonlinear, constraints to mimic the complex phase relationships.\n\n3. **Attempting a Real-Valued Reformulation**:  \n   It is mathematically possible to reformulate quantum mechanics in terms of only real numbers\u2014by splitting the complex wavefunction into its real and imaginary parts, one can write a set of coupled real equations. However, these equations lose the elegant linear structure and simple phase-rotation symmetry (U(1) symmetry) that the complex formulation provides. Instead, you end up with a system that is formally equivalent but less transparent; the interplay between the two real components is effectively \u201cnonlinear\u201d in the sense that the phase information (which now is hidden in the relation between the two components) is not as straightforward to interpret as a simple rotation in a complex plane.\n\n4. **What Would an Equivalent Nonlinear Real-Valued Theory Look Like?**  \n   If you tried to construct a purely real theory that directly mimics the predictions of quantum mechanics, you\u2019d need to build in interference \u201cby hand.\u201d One approach is to use the hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics (the Madelung transformation), where you write the wavefunction in polar form:\n   \\[\n   \\psi(x,t) = \\sqrt{\\rho(x,t)}\\, e^{iS(x,t)/\\hbar}.\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\rho\\) is the probability density and \\(S\\) is the phase (action). The resulting equations are a continuity equation for \\(\\rho\\) and a modified Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation for \\(S\\) that includes the so-called quantum potential. In this formulation, the quantum effects emerge from a nonlinear coupling between \\(\\rho\\) and \\(S\\). However, this formulation is less fundamental; it is equivalent to the complex Schr\u00f6dinger equation only because of the underlying complex structure that was \u201chidden\u201d when you made the polar decomposition. The nonlinearity in these equations is precisely what you would need to reintroduce to capture the effects of interference that in the complex formulation come naturally from linear superposition with complex phases.\n\nIn summary, the difference is not merely that quantum mechanics uses complex numbers. It\u2019s that the complex structure is intrinsic to the theory\u2019s ability to capture interference and superposition in a way that is not just a matter of representation change. Any attempt to rewrite the theory purely in terms of real numbers ends up either being equivalent to the complex formulation (by doubling variables) or requires the introduction of nonlinearity to re-create the interference effects. That nonlinearity, in essence, is a proxy for the \u201cmissing\u201d phase information, and it shows why the abstract notion of phase in quantum mechanics isn\u2019t merely a mathematical artifact but a central component of its physical structure."

              "It can be helpful to distinguish **two different things** that happen to involve complex numbers:\n\n1. **Classical linear systems** that can be expressed in either real or complex form (like a pendulum or a classical wave).  \n2. **Quantum wavefunctions**, which are intrinsically complex (or equivalently, a coupled set of two real fields) and carry a probabilistic meaning when squared.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Classical Waves vs. Complex Representation as a Convenience\n\nIn classical wave problems (e.g., sound waves, water waves, or a simple pendulum\u2019s motion), you might use complex exponentials to **make the math more convenient**, but physically:\n\n- The \u201ctrue\u201d underlying variable is typically **real** (e.g., displacement, pressure).\n- Writing it in complex form is just a shortcut. You can always take the real part at the end (or combine the real and imaginary parts appropriately) to get the physically observed quantity.\n  \n**In short:** in classical wave mathematics, using complex numbers is a bookkeeping trick. It doesn\u2019t *fundamentally* change the physics\u2014no actual physical quantity depends on the imaginary part alone. The complex representation is fully equivalent to a real formulation, and *no physics is lost or gained* by working in one representation or the other.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Quantum Wavefunctions as Fundamental Complex Fields\n\nQuantum mechanics, however, *appears* to require complex wavefunctions at a deeper level:\n\n1. **The Schr\u00f6dinger Equation is Intrinsically Complex**  \n   \\[\n   i \\hbar \\,\\partial_{t}\\psi \\;=\\; -\\,\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\nabla^{2}\\psi \\;+\\; V\\,\\psi.\n   \\]  \n   The presence of \\( i = \\sqrt{-1} \\) is not just a convenience; it is a structural feature of how quantum states evolve. You can try rewriting \\(\\psi\\) as two real fields (e.g. \\(\\psi = R\\,e^{i\\theta}\\) and then separate real and imaginary parts), but you will find two *coupled* partial differential equations, each depending on the other.\n\n2. **Probabilities vs. Amplitudes**  \n   - In classical wave systems, you can measure the amplitude of the wave (e.g., how far a pendulum is displaced), so the wave\u2019s amplitude is physically observable.  \n   - In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction \\(\\psi\\) is *not* directly observable; only \\(|\\psi|^2\\) is observed as a probability density. Interference, superposition, and other \u201cpurely quantum\u201d effects arise *because* of the way complex amplitudes combine before we take the absolute square to get probabilities.\n\n3. **No Real-Valued Equivalent That\u2019s Just as Simple**  \n   Although you *can* rewrite the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in purely real form (two coupled equations for the real part and the imaginary part, or for amplitude and phase), it\u2019s no longer the same as a single real PDE describing a single field. Quantum phenomena such as interference and the global structure of the wavefunction become awkward in a purely real framework with no \u201cbuilt-in\u201d notion of global phase.  \n   - You might say \u201cbut in classical waves, rewriting as sine and cosine was still linear.\u201d Indeed, but in quantum mechanics, the *interpretation* of the wavefunction as something that leads to probabilities by \\(|\\psi|^2\\) is different; it\u2019s not just a real field you measure at each point in space.  \n   - If you tried to build a purely real-valued theory that emulates *all* quantum predictions, you end up effectively re-inventing the same underlying structure that the complex formalism already captures neatly, often with **extra constraints** or **nonlinear terms** to keep track of a hidden \u201cphase-like\u201d variable.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why Is This Fundamentally Different?\n\n- **In classical Fourier analysis**, writing a real wave as \\( \\cos(\\omega t) \\) or as \\( \\frac{1}{2}(e^{i \\omega t} + e^{-i \\omega t}) \\) is a choice of representation. *Both forms describe the same physically measurable wave.*  \n- **In quantum mechanics**, the wavefunction is *more* than just a convenience:  \n  1. Measurement outcomes derive from \\(|\\psi|^2\\).  \n  2. Interference and superposition hinge on summing the complex amplitudes *before* squaring.  \n  3. Global phase might be unobservable, but *relative* phase between components of a wavefunction directly affects measurable outcomes (e.g., interference patterns).\n\nThis is why quantum mechanics cannot simply be described by \u201creal probability densities that evolve linearly.\u201d That misses the crucial piece: *the relative phases among components of the state,* which directly affect measurable outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. A Hypothetical \u201cNonlinear Real Theory\u201d\n\nYou asked, *\u201cWhat would an equivalent nonlinear real-valued theory look like?\u201d*\n\n- In principle, you could attempt to construct a single real PDE that captures all quantum predictions. But it typically ends up being **more complicated** (often **nonlinear**) and less elegant than the standard complex linear form. You have to introduce hidden variables or constraints to track the \u201cphase-like\u201d information.  \n- Historically, people have tried real formulations (like the **Madelung transformation**, rewriting \\(\\psi = R\\,e^{i\\theta}\\) in terms of fluid-like equations). The result is a system of coupled real equations for \\(R\\) and \\(\\theta\\) that has a \u201cquantum pressure\u201d term. You can do it, but the physics is the same, and the quantum \u201cweirdness\u201d is still there in the extra terms and constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Yes**, complex exponentials in classical wave theory are a convenient mathematical trick, and in principle you *could* do everything purely in real terms. You lose no physical content by ignoring the imaginary part as \u201cunphysical\u201d and taking real parts at the end.  \n- **No**, in quantum mechanics you *cannot* just drop half of the wavefunction or treat the complex form as a mere convenience. Its phase structure (and therefore interference) is crucial to the theory\u2019s predictions, and you can\u2019t replicate that exactly with *just* a single real function in a simple, linear PDE.\n\nSo even though both classical waves and quantum mechanics can involve complex functions, the **meaning** of the complex structure in quantum mechanics\u2014carrying interference and phase crucial to measurable outcomes\u2014makes it fundamentally different from the purely \u201cauxiliary\u201d role of complex math in classical linear waves."

              "It\u2019s certainly conceivable that a future reformulation of quantum theory would look very different from the usual wavefunction-based approach. However, **any** successful alternative must reproduce all the well-tested predictions of quantum mechanics\u2014*including* interference phenomena, nonlocal correlations (as in Bell experiments), and so on. This puts strong constraints on what that \u201cno-wavefunction\u201d picture can look like.\n\nBelow are several key points and trade-offs such a theory would confront:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Existing \u201cWavefunction-Free\u201d Approaches Already Exist\u2014in a Sense\n\n1. **Phase Space Formulations**:  \n   - You can rewrite quantum mechanics in terms of quasiprobability distributions (like the Wigner function) on phase space. However, these distributions can go *negative* or exhibit other \u201cnonclassical\u201d features. This is a sign that something unusual (compared to classical probability) remains in the theory.  \n   - So although you aren\u2019t using a wavefunction explicitly, all the quantum weirdness still creeps in via nonclassical probability behavior.\n\n2. **Hidden-Variable Theories**:  \n   - *Bohmian Mechanics (Pilot-Wave Theory)*: Particles have definite positions at all times, guided by a \u201cpilot wave\u201d (which is mathematically the wavefunction). While it\u2019s \u201chidden variable\u201d in spirit, it still uses the wavefunction for the guiding equation.  \n   - *Objective Collapse Theories (e.g., GRW)*: Try to modify the standard Schr\u00f6dinger equation by adding random collapses. These still have a wavefunction, but wavefunction *collapse* is built in as a physical process.\n\n**Bottom line**: Even in theories that try to avoid the wavefunction as the sole fundamental object, you typically end up with *something* that plays the same role\u2014carrying amplitude and phase information that produce interference and correlate outcomes in the usual quantum way.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Trade-offs Any Alternative Must Face\n\n1. **Nonlocality or Contextuality**  \n   - Bell\u2019s theorem and the Kochen\u2013Specker theorem impose serious constraints on hidden-variable theories or classical-like models. If you want to reproduce quantum predictions, you can\u2019t have a purely local or non-contextual model.  \n   - This means that any wavefunction-free theory that still matches experiments would likely have to be *nonlocal*, *contextual*, or otherwise incorporate \u201cspooky\u201d correlations we typically associate with quantum mechanics.\n\n2. **Mathematical Complexity**  \n   - The wavefunction approach has a clean *linear* evolution (the Schr\u00f6dinger equation) plus a probabilistic measurement postulate. Any purely real or classical-like alternative often ends up with complicated, typically *nonlinear* equations if it tries to encode quantum phenomena without an amplitude+phase formalism.\n\n3. **Emergent or Epistemic Interpretations**  \n   - Some researchers explore the idea that the wavefunction might be an *epistemic* or *emergent* object (related to knowledge states rather than an actual physical field). That\u2019s another way to \u201cnot have a wavefunction\u201d at the fundamental level, but at the cost of adding interpretational baggage\u2014explaining how a new, deeper theory yields the appearance of wavefunctions and interference at higher levels.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What Must Be Explained?\n\nAny candidate theory must explain or reproduce:\n\n1. **Interference and Superposition**:  \n   - The heart of quantum mechanics is that amplitudes (somehow) combine and interfere *before* we square them to get probabilities. A no-wavefunction theory must still \u201cknow\u201d how to produce these patterns that have no classical analog.\n\n2. **Entanglement and Nonlocal Correlations**:  \n   - Experiments demonstrating violations of Bell inequalities show that nature can\u2019t be explained by local, classical-like hidden-variable theories. An alternative theory must replicate these correlations without a wavefunction, which is nontrivial.\n\n3. **Measurement Postulates and Collapse**:  \n   - In standard quantum mechanics, you evolve unitarily via the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, but measurements appear to \u201ccollapse\u201d the state. A no-wavefunction theory needs an account of why measurements yield discrete outcomes with the correct probabilities, *and* how interference is lost post-measurement.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Is It Likely?\n\n- It\u2019s *always* possible that a deeper theory (one that we might interpret as having \u201cno wavefunction\u201d) awaits discovery. Physicists remain open to new formulations\u2014especially if they unify quantum theory with gravity or resolve other open questions (like the measurement problem or the nature of the wavefunction).  \n- However, each alternative so far either ends up **equivalent** to standard quantum mechanics in predictions (meaning it\u2019s really just a reinterpretation with wavefunction \u201chiding behind the curtain\u201d) or it introduces new complexities or assumptions that have yet to be experimentally confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary\n\n- A future, radically different formulation **could** drop explicit wavefunctions, but it would need to preserve everything quantum theory does well\u2014like accurately predicting interference patterns and nonlocal correlations.  \n- Historically, attempts to do this (hidden variables, collapse models, phase space formalisms) have *not* rid the theory of something wavefunction-like; they either embed it in guiding equations, allow negative probabilities, or impose nonlocal structures.  \n- So, while it\u2019s not impossible that a *fundamentally new* formulation without wavefunctions might emerge, any such theory will have to replicate the quantum results we know and love, including the \u201cweird\u201d stuff. And that typically means reintroducing the wavefunction\u2019s role in disguise, or else paying the price in other ways (nonlinearity, nonlocality, or added structure)."

              "The phrase \u201cthermodynamic computer\u201d isn\u2019t a standard term you\u2019ll find widely defined in textbooks\u2014rather, it\u2019s more of a catchall or speculative label that pops up in research and startup marketing. It generally suggests a form of computing that directly leverages thermodynamic principles (heat, energy exchange, entropy, etc.) as part of its fundamental operations or design. Here are a few contexts where the phrase might appear:\n\n1. **Reversible or Low-Energy Computing**  \n   - *Background*: There\u2019s a long-standing idea, based on Landauer\u2019s Principle and related work, that the minimal energy cost of computation is tied to erasing bits and increasing entropy. Some researchers explore \u201creversible computing,\u201d designed to minimize energy loss.  \n   - *Connection to \u2018Thermodynamic Computing\u2019*: A device built to operate close to thermodynamic limits\u2014or to actively harness those limits\u2014could be pitched as a \u201cthermodynamic computer.\u201d\n\n2. **Stochastic/Thermally Driven Computation**  \n   - *Background*: In certain models (especially in nanotechnology), random thermal fluctuations are not purely viewed as noise but as something that can be harnessed for computational tasks (e.g., random search, sampling, or advanced optimization).  \n   - *Connection to \u2018Thermodynamic Computing\u2019*: A system that uses heat or thermal agitation to drive part of the computational process might be referred to this way, though such systems are still very much in research phases.\n\n3. **Physics-Based or Neuromorphic-Like Systems**  \n   - *Background*: Some startups and labs talk about \u201cphysics-based AI\u201d or \u201cneuromorphic computing,\u201d where they create analog systems that solve certain classes of problems more directly than digital electronics.  \n   - *Connection to \u2018Thermodynamic Computing\u2019*: These often rely on the energy dynamics of physical components (like memristors or oscillatory networks). The marketing term \u201cthermodynamic computer\u201d might be used when describing networks that reach equilibrium states through energy flow.\n\n4. **Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics as a Computing Resource**  \n   - *Background*: There is a branch of research investigating how driven, non-equilibrium systems (where there\u2019s a constant flow of energy) can encode or process information in new ways.  \n   - *Connection to \u2018Thermodynamic Computing\u2019*: If a startup is experimenting with novel materials or devices that exploit non-equilibrium phenomena to do computations, that might be described as a \u201cthermodynamic computer.\u201d\n\nBecause the term itself is not standardized, different groups might use \u201cthermodynamic computing\u201d to emphasize different aspects\u2014anything from specialized hardware that dissipates almost no heat (thus operating at near thermodynamic limits), to analog or probabilistic machines that rely on thermal fluctuations as part of the logic. If a startup claims to be building one, they may be aiming for:\n\n- **Ultra-low power operation** (beyond the efficiency of conventional CMOS electronics).  \n- **Novel architectures** that naturally solve certain optimization or AI tasks.  \n- **Theoretical breakthroughs** in using physical laws to compute in ways that typical microchips don\u2019t.\n\nIn short, \u201cthermodynamic computer\u201d is an umbrella phrase referencing the idea of computing that is deeply tied to principles of heat flow and energy exchange, rather than relying solely on digital transistor logic. If you see it in a startup context, it\u2019s likely they are exploring (or at least marketing) the potential for ultra-efficient or physically inspired computation that uses thermodynamic processes in a fundamental way."
