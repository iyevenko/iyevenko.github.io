              "In the usual terminology of vector calculus (or differential equations), *any* single-valued, sufficiently smooth vector field already has the property that its field lines (also called *integral curves*, *streamlines*, or *trajectories*) do not cross except possibly at points where the field is zero or not well-defined. In other words, there isn\u2019t a special name reserved just for \u201ca vector field with no crossing lines\u201d; it is simply a consequence of the **uniqueness of solutions** to the differential equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}),\n\\]\n\nprovided \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is a well-defined (single-valued) and sufficiently smooth function.\n\n---\n\n### Why integral curves do not cross\n\n1. **Uniqueness of solutions (Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem)**  \n   If \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is continuous and satisfies a Lipschitz condition on a domain, then for each point \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\), there is a unique solution \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) with \\(\\mathbf{x}(0)=\\mathbf{x}_0\\). Two different trajectories cannot go through the same point with the same direction of motion unless the field is zero or not uniquely defined there.\n\n2. **Interpretation in physics**  \n   - **Electric or magnetic field lines**: In electromagnetism, you often hear \u201cfield lines never cross.\u201d This is just another way of stating that at each point in space, the field has one unique direction.  \n   - **Fluid flow (streamlines)**: Streamlines of a velocity field in a fluid do not cross unless there is some singularity (like a stagnation point or discontinuity).\n\n3. **Exceptional cases**  \n   - **Zero or undefined points**: If \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}_0)=\\mathbf{0}\\), then the direction of the vector field at \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\) is \u201cno direction,\u201d so multiple integral curves could, in principle, meet there (think of a sink or source in a fluid).  \n   - **Non-smooth fields**: If the vector field is not differentiable or does not satisfy a Lipschitz condition, uniqueness of solutions can fail, and crossing curves can occur.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- There is no special name like \u201ccross-free vector field\u201d in standard usage; rather, **any well-defined, smooth vector field inherently has non-crossing integral curves** (except at singularities).  \n- Sometimes people refer to specific types of vector fields (e.g., *irrotational*, *solenoidal*, *gradient fields*), but those labels pertain to whether the vector field has zero curl, zero divergence, or is the gradient of some potential\u2014not specifically about crossing or non-crossing of field lines.  \n\nThus, if you see a properly drawn diagram of a single-valued, smooth vector field whose lines intersect in the interior of the domain, that typically signals a mistake in the diagram, not a special type of field."

Symbolically,\n\n\\[\n\\delta F \n\\,\\equiv\\, \\int d x \\,\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)}\\,\\delta A(x),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)}\\) is the functional derivative of \\(F\\) w.r.t. \\(A(x)\\).  \n\n### Functional divergence\nIf someone writes\n\\[\n\\text{(functional divergence)} \\;=\\; \n\\int dx \\,\\left[\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A(x)}\\right],\n\\]\nthey are essentially summing (integrating) the \u201cdirectional derivative\u201d \\(\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta A(x)}\\) over all points \\(x\\). This is somewhat analogous to the usual divergence \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}\\) being the sum of partial derivatives.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The functional analogue of \u201ccurl\u201d\n\nIn finite dimensions, \u201ccurl\u201d is the next step after divergence in the de\u202fRham complex (0-form \\(\\to\\) 1-form \\(\\to\\) 2-form). In an infinite-dimensional setting, the corresponding idea is:\n\n1. Start with a **0-form** in field space, which is just a functional \\(F[A]\\).  \n2. Take its **exterior derivative** in field space to get a **1-form**, which is\n   \\[\n   dF \\;=\\; \\int dx \\,\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)}\\,\\delta A(x).\n   \\]\n3. To get the analogue of a \u201ccurl,\u201d you apply the exterior derivative **again** to obtain a **2-form** in field space:\n   \\[\n   d(dF) \n   \\;=\\; \n   \\int dx \\int dy\\, \\frac{\\delta^2 F}{\\delta A(x)\\,\\delta A(y)}\\;\\delta A(x)\\,\\wedge\\,\\delta A(y).\n   \\]\n   - This is sometimes called the \u201csecond variation\u201d of \\(F\\) but viewed **antisymmetrically** (\\(\\wedge\\)) in the different field coordinates \\(A(x)\\).  \n   - Geometrically, this 2-form is the infinite-dimensional analogue of the curl (which in 3D is also connected to the second step in the de\u202fRham sequence).  \n\nHence, **the functional analogue of taking the curl** is basically taking the **exterior derivative of the 1-form** that you got from the first functional derivative. Concretely, it is captured by the **antisymmetric part** of the **second functional derivative** \\(\\frac{\\delta^2 F}{\\delta A(x)\\,\\delta A(y)}\\).  \n\n### Not a single \u201cname,\u201d but an operation\nUnlike finite-dimensional vector calculus\u2014where we have a neat label \u201c\\(\\nabla \\times\\mathbf{F}\\)\u201d\u2014in field theory or the calculus of variations, you rarely see a standalone name like \u201cfunctional curl.\u201d Instead, one says \u201cthe **second variation** of \\(F\\)\u201d or \u201cthe **exterior derivative** of the 1-form \\(\\delta F\\).\u201d Mathematically, it is part of the **(infinite-dimensional) de\u202fRham complex** on the space of fields.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Summary\n\n- **Functional gradient** \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) 1st functional derivative \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)}\\).  \n- **Functional divergence** \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) integrated trace of the 1st functional derivative, \\(\\int dx\\,\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta A(x)}(\\dots)\\).  \n- **Functional curl** \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) in the language of differential forms on function space, it is the **exterior derivative** of the 1-form \\(\\delta F\\). Concretely, it\u2019s given by the **antisymmetric part** of the second functional derivative \\(\\frac{\\delta^2 F}{\\delta A(x)\\,\\delta A(y)}\\).  \n\nThat second step is seldom called \u201ccurl\u201d in field theory texts, but that is the closest functional analogue of \\(\\nabla \\times\\) in the usual 3D setting."

              "First, let\u2019s restate the setting:\n\n- We have a **double pendulum**, which is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom.  \n- Its phase space is 4-dimensional, with coordinates \\((q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2)\\).  \n- The flow in this phase space is given by Hamilton\u2019s equations \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\).  \n- By **Liouville\u2019s theorem**, the flow is volume-preserving (\u201cincompressible\u201d) in phase space.\n\nBelow are answers to your questions:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Do the trajectories (flow lines) ever intersect?\n\n**No, they do not intersect** because each point in phase space has a unique velocity vector \\(\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\). By the uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations (Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem), once you specify an initial condition in phase space, there is exactly one orbit through that point. If two orbits were to intersect, they would share the same point and velocity at some instant, contradicting uniqueness.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Do they come arbitrarily close (Poincar\u00e9 recurrence)?\n\nIn many bounded Hamiltonian systems (especially if they are **ergodic** on some energy surface), the **Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem** implies that almost all points in a finite-volume region of phase space are *recurrent*. This means that if you follow one orbit long enough, it will return arbitrarily close to its initial point (and hence arbitrarily close to other points on that same invariant energy surface). \n\n- **Close but not crossing:**  \n  Even though they come arbitrarily close, the trajectories do not cross. \u201cClose\u201d in a 4D space is not the same as \u201ccoinciding,\u201d so the flow preserves uniqueness while still exhibiting intricate, repeated near-returns.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Must individual orbits form complex \u201cknots\u201d in 4D?\n\nBecause the flow lines **cannot intersect**, yet can wander around in a finite region, they can indeed form topologically complicated orbits in 4D. You can think of these as \u201c4D knots\u201d (though the formal theory of knotting in 4D is more subtle than in 3D). \n\n- **Chaotic orbits** in the double pendulum can become extremely tangled, winding around the energy surface in a complicated pattern, without ever intersecting themselves.  \n- In 4D, there is \u201cmore room\u201d to avoid self-intersection compared to lower-dimensional spaces, but the fundamental topological restriction is still that a single solution curve cannot cross itself or meet another distinct solution curve.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Can we compare the phase-space flow to a fluid flow?\n\nYes\u2014**Hamiltonian phase flow is exactly analogous to an incompressible fluid flow**, but in 4D instead of 3D:\n\n- **Incompressibility (Liouville\u2019s theorem):**  \n  The Hamiltonian flow preserves the symplectic volume in phase space, playing the same role as an incompressible flow preserving volume in physical (3D) space.\n\n- **Velocity field in 4D:**  \n  At every point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in phase space, the \u201cflow velocity\u201d is \\(\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\). You can think of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) as a \u201cfluid particle\u201d in 4D being carried by this velocity field.\n\n- **No sources or sinks in phase space:**  \n  Since \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = 0\\) in Hamiltonian mechanics (in the symplectic sense), the flow is divergence-free. This ensures volume is neither created nor destroyed in phase space, mirroring incompressible fluid flow.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **No Intersections:**  \n   Orbits in phase space never intersect because solutions to Hamilton\u2019s equations are unique.\n\n2. **Recurrence & Complexity:**  \n   Orbits can come arbitrarily close to themselves (Poincar\u00e9 recurrence) and can form highly intricate paths (akin to \u201cknots\u201d in 4D).\n\n3. **Incompressible Flow Analogy:**  \n   Hamiltonian dynamics in phase space behaves like an incompressible fluid flow, but in a higher-dimensional setting.\n\nAll of these features\u2014uniqueness, non-intersecting orbits, recurrence, and volume preservation\u2014combine to give rich and often chaotic behavior, particularly in a system as famously complex as the double pendulum."

A famous example is the 1D *logistic map*, which can be chaotic under certain parameter values. So, dimension arguments differ between discrete iterations and continuous flows.\n\n---\n\n## Answering the Two Questions\n\n### 1. Linking \u201cRandom Walk Recurrence\u201d to \u201cNo Chaos Below 3D\u201d?\n\nThey\u2019re somewhat **analogous** but not **equivalent**:\n\n- In a 2D random walk, \u201crecurrence\u201d means you (almost surely) come back arbitrarily close to your starting point at some (random) times.  \n- In a 2D **continuous ODE** flow (not a random walk!), the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem says there can be no chaotic attractors.  \n\nSo, there is a *hint of parallel*\u2014\u201csomething special happens in 2D that prevents certain complexities\u201d\u2014but the mechanisms are entirely different:\n\n- **Random walk** arguments rely on probability, Markov chain properties, and discrete steps.  \n- **Dynamical-system non-chaos** in 2D ODEs relies on continuous flows and topological constraints (Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson).\n\nHence, while both \u201c2D random walks are recurrent\u201d and \u201c2D continuous ODEs cannot have chaos\u201d are true, they arise from very different theorems and do not directly imply one another.\n\n---\n\n### 2. \u201cCould we conjecture no chaotic system with a phase space of dimension < 3?\u201d\n\n- For **continuous-time** systems (ODEs) on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), we indeed **need at least 3 dimensions** to have *chaotic* behavior in the usual sense (sensitive dependence on initial conditions plus a strange attractor).  \n- In **two dimensions**, the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem essentially *forbids* chaos. That is a proven fact, not just a conjecture.  \n- However, **be careful**: in **discrete-time** dynamics (maps, iterated functions), you *can* have chaos in dimension 1 or 2. So the statement \u201cno chaos in < 3D\u201d strictly applies to *continuous flows*, not to all dynamical systems.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n1. **Random walk recurrence (2D vs. 3D)** is a *probabilistic* statement about a Markov process on a lattice.  \n2. **Absence of chaos in 2D continuous ODEs** is a *deterministic/topological* statement (Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson).  \n3. For **continuous-time** dynamical systems, there is indeed **no chaotic attractor** if the phase space is only 2-dimensional. **Dimension \\(\\ge 3\\) is required**.  \n4. In **discrete-time** (maps), chaos can occur even in 1D or 2D (e.g., logistic map, H\u00e9non map).\n\nThey are analogous in that \u201csomething special about 2D\u201d prevents unbounded wandering (random walks) or chaotic attractors (continuous ODEs), but the underlying reasons and theorems are distinct."

              "First, let\u2019s untangle some terminology:  \n\n- **Parameter space** usually refers to the space of *system parameters* (e.g., mass, length, damping coefficients, etc.). Varying these parameters changes the *form* of the equations of motion.  \n- **Phase space** (or state space) refers to the space of *system states* (e.g., positions and momenta/velocities). A specific set of parameters defines a particular dynamical system in which trajectories evolve in phase space.  \n\nWhen we talk about \u201cchaotic attractors,\u201d we\u2019re almost always referring to *sets in the phase space*, not in the parameter space.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Chaotic Attractors Are in (State) Phase Space\n\nA **chaotic attractor** is a *bounded, invariant* set in the phase (state) space to which almost all nearby trajectories converge (for a *dissipative* system). Key properties of such an attractor usually include:\n\n1. **Invariance**: Once a trajectory is on the attractor, it stays there (it is forward-invariant under the flow).  \n2. **Attraction**: Trajectories in some open \u201cbasin of attraction\u201d in phase space approach the attractor as \\( t \\to \\infty \\).  \n3. **Sensitive dependence on initial conditions** (chaos): Trajectories on the attractor can separate exponentially fast if you pick two nearby points on it.\n\n> **Important**: In *Hamiltonian* (energy-conserving) systems like the **ideal** double pendulum (no friction), there is no *dissipation*. Consequently, there is typically *no attractor* in the strict sense, because trajectories do not settle onto a smaller set\u2014they fill out surfaces or regions (e.g., an energy surface in phase space). You *can* still have \u201cchaotic regions,\u201d \u201cchaotic orbits,\u201d or \u201cchaotic scattering,\u201d but not a dissipative chaotic attractor that pulls in other trajectories.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Is There a \u201cRegion That Cannot Be Escaped\u201d in 3D?\n\nYes, for **dissipative** systems in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) (e.g. the **Lorenz system**), there is often an **absorbing set**: a bounded region in phase space that, once entered, no trajectory can leave. All trajectories eventually end up inside this \u201cbox\u201d (or sphere, or other shape). Within (or as a subset of) that absorbing set, the **chaotic attractor** resides.\n\n- **Lorenz system example**:  \n  \\[\n    \\begin{cases}\n      \\dot{x} = \\sigma (y - x),\\\\\n      \\dot{y} = x(r - z) - y,\\\\\n      \\dot{z} = xy - b\\,z.\n    \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n  For certain parameter values \\((\\sigma, r, b)\\), you can prove there exists a region (e.g. a large sphere) in which all trajectories eventually remain. Inside that region lies the famous *Lorenz attractor*, a complicated fractal set on which chaotic motion occurs.\n\n- **Double pendulum example** (ideal, no friction):  \n  - This is a **Hamiltonian system**, so it *conserves energy* and does *not* have a strict attractor. Instead, each trajectory stays on a constant-energy surface in 4D phase space. Some parts of that energy surface can exhibit chaotic trajectories (they never settle onto a smaller subset), but there\u2019s no \u201cpulling in\u201d from outside because there is no dissipation.\n\nThus, for a dissipative system, you *can* draw a bounded region in phase space that traps trajectories forever (an *absorbing set*). For a purely Hamiltonian system, energy conservation means trajectories do not leave their energy surface, but that entire energy surface is typically not a smaller \u201cattractor\u201d in the dissipative sense.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relation to Parameters\n\n- **Parameter space**: Each choice of system parameters (e.g., \\(\\sigma, r, b\\) for Lorenz; or mass, length, damping for a pendulum) defines *one* vector field in phase space.\n- **Phase space**: For that fixed set of parameters, trajectories evolve in the (e.g., 3D) state space (or 4D for double pendulum).  \n- As you vary parameters, the *geometry* of the phase-space flow can change, leading to bifurcations. In the Lorenz system, you move from stable fixed points, to limit cycles, to chaotic attractors, depending on parameter values.\n\n---\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\n1. **Chaotic attractors** live in *phase space*, not parameter space. They are *bounded, invariant sets* that attract nearby trajectories in *dissipative* systems.  \n2. **You can typically enclose an attractor** in a larger (but finite) \u201cabsorbing region,\u201d so that no trajectory escapes once inside.  \n3. **Hamiltonian systems** (e.g., ideal double pendulum) do *not* have attractors in the strict sense, since there is no dissipation. Trajectories remain on an energy surface, which can contain regular (non-chaotic) or chaotic orbits, but it\u2019s not an \u201cattractor.\u201d  \n4. **Parameters** define which particular dynamical system you get. By changing parameters, you can move in *parameter space*, potentially turning a system from non-chaotic to chaotic, but the *chaotic attractor itself* is always described in *phase space*."

              "First, let\u2019s clarify the setting:\n\n- The **Lorenz system** is a classic example of a **dissipative** (non-Hamiltonian) dynamical system.  \n- In such systems, trajectories contract volume in phase space overall (i.e., \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} < 0\\) on average), eventually settling onto some **attractor** if one exists for given parameters.  \n- The \u201cLorenz attractor\u201d is famously **chaotic** and (for certain parameter values) is a **strange attractor** with fractal structure.\n\nBelow is a concise overview addressing your questions about the **phase-space density** on this chaotic attractor:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Is the density constant within the attractor\u2019s region?\n\n**No.**  \nUnlike a Hamiltonian (incompressible) system where Liouville\u2019s theorem guarantees volume preservation (and hence one might consider uniform density on a constant-energy surface), a **dissipative** system such as the Lorenz flow **does not** preserve volume. Therefore, there is no reason for the induced phase-space density on the attractor to be uniform or constant.\n\nInstead, the Lorenz attractor typically carries a **singular (fractal) measure**. This measure assigns \u201cmost of the weight\u201d to the points on the attractor but is *zero* outside it in the long-time limit. Moreover, the density (if you try to visualize it) is very *non-uniform* across the attractor and often has a complicated, self-similar structure.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Is there an invariant quantity?\n\nYes, there is typically an **invariant measure**\u2014often called an **SRB measure** (Sinai\u2013Ruelle\u2013Bowen measure)\u2014associated with a chaotic attractor in a dissipative system. Key features:\n\n1. **Invariant under the flow**: If you start with this measure as your \u201cinitial distribution\u201d of points in phase space, evolution under the Lorenz equations maps it onto itself.  \n2. **Physical measure**: In many chaotic systems (including Lorenz), almost all initial conditions in some open region converge to this measure on the attractor. Hence, if you pick a random initial state in that region, its long-term statistics match those predicted by the SRB measure.\n\n> **But**: There is no single, simple *scalar function* (like energy in a Hamiltonian system) that remains constant over the entire attractor. Instead, the flow continuously **dissipates** volume but balances on the chaotic set, leading to a complicated stationary measure supported on the attractor.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Boundedness vs. invariance\n\n- **Boundedness**: In many dissipative systems (including the Lorenz system for classical parameter choices), there is a **trapping region** or **absorbing set** in phase space. Once trajectories enter this set, they cannot leave, which ensures that the attractor itself is *bounded*.  \n- **Invariance**: The **attractor** is *invariant* under the flow. That is, if a trajectory is on the attractor at some time, it remains on it for all future times.\n\nHence, one typically says the attractor is a **bounded, invariant set** carrying an invariant measure (the SRB measure). That measure is not constant: it generally exhibits a fractal geometry and a non-uniform distribution of points.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary\n\n1. **The density on the Lorenz attractor is not constant**; it is typically a **fractal (singular) measure**.  \n2. **There is an invariant measure (SRB measure)** on the attractor, which describes the long-term statistical behavior of almost all trajectories in the basin of attraction.  \n3. **The attractor is bounded** (confined to a region in phase space) but **not volume-filling** and does *not* carry a uniform density because the system is dissipative rather than volume-preserving."

              "First, it is important to note that the **Lorenz attractor** (and most other \u201cstrange\u201d or chaotic attractors in dissipative systems) is typically a **fractally structured set** in phase space\u2014not a smooth manifold. Its \u201cdimension\u201d (the so-called **Lyapunov or Hausdorff dimension**) lies between integer values. Because of this fractal nature, one does not expect any neat, closed-form description such as an explicit surface equation \\(F(x, y, z) = 0\\), nor a straightforward PDE whose solution set is exactly the attractor.\n\nBelow are several points that shed light on why such a neat description does not exist\u2014and what partial or approximate descriptions are possible:\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Lorenz System and Its Origins\n\nThe **Lorenz system** arises from a simplified model of fluid convection, which itself derives from the **Navier\u2013Stokes equations** (a PDE system). Edward Lorenz truncated an infinite series expansion of the convection equations (the **Saltzman equations**, which come from the Boussinesq approximation to Navier\u2013Stokes) to get just three coupled ODEs:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot x = \\sigma (y - x), \\\\\n\\dot y = x(r - z) - y, \\\\\n\\dot z = xy - b \\, z.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThe resulting dynamical system can display chaotic behavior for certain parameter values \\((\\sigma, r, b)\\). So, in a sense, the Lorenz equations *are already* a simplified ODE subsystem derived from a PDE. But the attractor itself\u2014this fractal set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\)\u2014is not the solution set of a simple PDE. It is (roughly speaking) the long-time \u201csteady-state\u201d of the Lorenz ODE flow, which was itself obtained from a PDE in a *highly truncated* fashion.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why No Simple PDE (or Surface Equation) Describes the Attractor\n\n1. **Fractal Geometry**:  \n   The Lorenz attractor is not a smooth 2D surface. It has complicated self-similar \u201cfolding and stretching,\u201d giving it a fractal dimension typically around 2.06 (depending on parameters). There\u2019s no known analytic function \\(F(x, y, z)\\) that vanishes *exactly* on this complicated fractal set.\n\n2. **Dissipative Chaos**:  \n   Dissipative systems continuously fold and stretch trajectories in phase space, creating thin \u201cleaves\u201d and intricate layering. This yields something that is topologically very different from a simple manifold boundary of a region. In effect, the set\u2019s geometry is defined by the infinite iteration of a nonlinear map, not by a single closed-form condition.\n\n3. **No Closed-Form Solutions**:  \n   Even the **ODE** solutions to the Lorenz system cannot, in general, be written in closed form. The attractor is a *global object* built from forward-time limits of almost all points in some region of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). \u201cSolving for the attractor\u201d is essentially as hard as \u201csolving the entire system\u201d explicitly\u2014which is not possible in elementary functions.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Invariant Manifolds vs. the Full Attractor\n\n- In lower-dimensional examples of chaotic systems, sometimes parts of the dynamics can be described by stable/unstable **manifolds** of fixed points or periodic orbits. These manifolds can be *locally* described by PDE-like expansions (e.g., expansions in power series or parameterizations), but globally they become very complicated.  \n- For the **Lorenz attractor** specifically, it is a union of complicated invariant manifolds (in a fractal arrangement), so that trying to describe the *entire* attractor by a single PDE or a single manifold equation is not feasible.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Approximate or Numerical Descriptions\n\nWhile no exact analytic \u201csurface\u201d or PDE exists that *directly and succinctly* characterizes the attractor, there are ways to approximate or partially describe it:\n\n1. **Numerical Integration & Phase Portraits**:  \n   One typically integrates the Lorenz ODEs for a long time, records the trajectory, and displays the chaotic set in a 3D plot. This gives a *visual approximation* of the attractor\u2019s geometry.\n\n2. **Fractal Measures & SRB Measures**:  \n   Dynamical systems theory tells us about the **invariant measure** (often called an **SRB measure**) supported on the attractor. This measure is typically singular (non-smooth) and can be numerically approximated as well.\n\n3. **Local Parameterizations**:  \n   In advanced dynamical systems theory, people study local stable and unstable manifolds near special orbits (like periodic orbits, or the unstable manifold of a saddle). One can sometimes write power-series expansions for local pieces of these manifolds, but stitching them together to cover the *entire* attractor remains difficult\u2014and the result is still fractal.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n1. **No global PDE** (or a single implicit equation \\(F(x, y, z) = 0\\)) exists that neatly *defines* the Lorenz attractor. The attractor is a **strange (fractal) set**, not a smooth surface.  \n2. The Lorenz system itself *comes from* (truncated) PDEs, but once reduced to 3D ODEs, the chaotic geometry we see is inherently the outcome of iterative folding/ stretching, not something described by a simple PDE condition.  \n3. **Numerical methods** and **geometric/dynamical analysis** (e.g., stable/unstable manifolds, SRB measures, fractal dimension calculations) are the best tools we have to characterize the Lorenz attractor\u2019s shape and statistics. There is no known (nor expected) closed-form or global PDE-based description of that fractal set."

              "First, you\u2019re absolutely correct that there isn\u2019t a sudden, \u201cbinary\u201d jump from a uniform distribution to a perfectly fractal distribution in a dissipative chaotic system like the Lorenz flow. Instead, there is a **continuous** (though often very rapid) evolution of the distribution in phase space toward what we call the **SRB measure** (Sinai\u2013Ruelle\u2013Bowen measure) supported on the strange attractor.\n\nBelow are some points that help clarify how this transition occurs in practice:\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Distribution Evolves Smoothly in Time\n\nIf you start with a large ensemble of initial conditions\u2014say uniformly distributed in some region of phase space\u2014and let them evolve under a *deterministic*, continuous flow \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\), then at each finite time \\(t\\), the \u201ccloud\u201d of points will still be described by some smooth measure (initially uniform, then continuously deformed). Mathematically, this evolution of density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) satisfies the **Liouville equation** (or a continuity equation of the form \\(\\partial_t \\rho = - \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\,\\mathbf{f})\\)).\n\n- **No abrupt jump:**  \n  There is no discrete event where the distribution flips from \u201cuniform\u201d to \u201cfractal.\u201d Instead, thin filaments and folds develop, getting exponentially more intricate due to chaotic stretching and folding.  \n\n- **Filamentation:**  \n  In chaotic regions, you get extremely fine \u201cstripes\u201d of high and low density. If you zoom out at finite time, the distribution can still look somewhat smooth (a \u201cfrothy\u201d mixture). If you zoom in, you see \u201cstripy\u201d structures getting thinner as time increases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Fractal Structure Emerges in the Infinite-Time Limit\n\nOver very long times, in a strongly dissipative chaotic system, almost all trajectories in some basin will settle onto the **strange attractor**. The limiting measure on that attractor is typically a **singular (fractal) measure**\u2014the SRB measure\u2014concentrated on a set of (Hausdorff) dimension less than the full phase-space dimension.\n\n- **At finite but large time:**  \n  You get a measure that is \u201cclose\u201d in a certain sense (often \u201cweak-* convergence\u201d in measure theory) to the limiting SRB measure. But it might still have small whiskers or bulges that haven\u2019t fully been drawn into the thinner filaments.\n\n- **In the strict \\(t \\to \\infty\\) limit:**  \n  The distribution is fully supported on the fractal attractor. One says \u201cthe measure is fractal\u201d because it places zero weight on the rest of the phase space and is typically non-uniformly distributed on a set of fractional dimension.\n\nHence, there is indeed a \u201csmooth approach\u201d to a fractal distribution, but the fractal geometry is only exact in the infinite-time limit. \n\n---\n\n## 3. \u201cIs It Fractal Yet?\u201d\u2014a Continuous but Rapid Process\n\nOne way to see that the transition is not strictly binary but rather a *continuous evolution* is to:\n\n1. **Numerically integrate** a large ensemble of points under the Lorenz system (or any dissipative chaotic flow).  \n2. **Visualize the density** at successive times. You will notice \u201cstretch-and-fold\u201d patterns. The density will appear increasingly intricate, forming thin ribbons or bands.  \n\nWith increasing time, these ribbons become so thin that, to any finite-resolution measurement, the distribution starts to *appear* fractal. However, from a purely mathematical standpoint, it is only *in the limit* \\(t \\to \\infty\\) that the measure is exactly the fractal (SRB) measure.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Analogy with Dye in a Chaotic Flow\n\nA nice physical analogy is **dye mixed in a chaotically stirred fluid** (like the \u201cchaotic mixing\u201d often demonstrated in a blinking vortex flow). Initially, the dye might be a smooth blob; as time progresses, it gets stretched into filaments. Under an idealized perfect mixing scenario (with some diffusion), the dye eventually becomes distributed in a complicated pattern. In a purely advective flow (no diffusion), those filaments become arbitrarily thin\u2014approaching a fractal-like distribution. Yet at any finite time, you still have a well-defined continuous concentration field.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- There is **no sharp, instantaneous** transition from uniform to fractal.  \n- In a **dissipative chaotic flow**, the phase-space density evolves continuously, developing ever finer structures (filamentation).  \n- In the long-time limit, the measure **converges** to a **singular (fractal) SRB measure** supported on the strange attractor.  \n- Thus, \u201cbeing fractal\u201d is more of an **asymptotic** property, rather than a discrete event."

              "First, let\u2019s clarify the objects involved when discussing the **Lorenz attractor** (in its chaotic regime):\n\n1. **The attractor itself**  \n   - This is the (fractal) set \\(A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3\\) in phase space toward which almost all trajectories converge as \\(t \\to \\infty\\).  \n   - Geometrically, \\(A\\) is neither a simple 2D surface nor a volume-filling region\u2014it has a non-integer (fractal) dimension somewhere between 2 and 3 (often quoted around \\(2.06\\)\u2013\\(2.1\\) for classic parameters).  \n   - Because it is fractal, there is no global, smooth manifold structure.\n\n2. **The invariant (SRB) measure** \\(\\mu\\) supported on the attractor  \n   - As time evolves under the Lorenz flow, almost every initial condition in some large \u201cbasin\u201d of phase space ends up distributing itself (in a measure-theoretic sense) onto \\(A\\).  \n   - This measure \\(\\mu\\) is typically singular with respect to the usual Lebesgue measure in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). Informally, \\(\\mu\\) is concentrated on a set of zero \u201cvolume,\u201d i.e., the fractal attractor.\n\n3. **The region \u201cwhere probability \\(> 0\\)\u201d**  \n   - Strictly speaking, once the system has converged, the measure of any point *off* the attractor is zero. So, if by \u201cregion where probability > 0\u201d you mean \u201cthe set of points in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) that carry positive measure under \\(\\mu\\),\u201d then that set is exactly (or is contained in) the fractal attractor.  \n   - Because \\(\\mu\\) is fractal, this support is *not* an open region nor a smooth manifold. It\u2019s a complicated subset with fractal geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Is the set \\(\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : \\mu(x) > 0 \\}\\) a fractal or a well-defined 2D manifold?\n\n- **It is fractal.**  \n  In a dissipative chaotic system like Lorenz, the long-time limiting measure is supported on the \u201cstrange attractor,\u201d which is a fractal set. The measure does *not* spread out continuously over a 2D surface.  \n- A well-defined 2D manifold in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) would be *smooth* (or at least piecewise smooth) and have integer dimension exactly 2. The Lorenz attractor does not satisfy that\u2014it has a fractal (non-integer) dimension, with intricate \u201cfolded\u201d layers visible under magnification.\n\nHence, the region in which the measure is strictly positive (if we look in the limit \\(t \\to \\infty\\)) *is* precisely this fractal set, not a smooth manifold.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Does a \u201cregion of positive probability\u201d in finite time look different?\n\n- At **finite time**, if you start with a continuous blob of initial conditions (e.g., uniform in a box), you still have a smooth density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)\\).  \n- However, that density will get \u201cfilamented\u201d (stretched and folded) in chaotic regions, forming thinner and thinner filaments.  \n- As \\(t\\to\\infty\\), those filaments become so thin that, in the limit, they converge to a measure fully concentrated on the fractal attractor. In that sense, there is a *continuous* approach to a fractal-support distribution.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Is there an analytic or numeric expression for the attractor?\n\n### Analytic?\n- **No simple closed-form expression** \\(F(x,y,z)=0\\) or PDE describing the Lorenz attractor as a \u201csurface\u201d is known (and it is overwhelmingly believed none exists).  \n- The attractor is not an algebraic or smooth surface but a **strange** (fractal) set emerging from the nonlinear, dissipative dynamics.\n\n### Numeric?\n- **Yes, but only in approximate form.**  \n  1. You can **integrate** the Lorenz equations \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\) (with standard parameters) from a dense set of initial points and record where they go as \\(t\\) grows large.  \n  2. Plotting those points in 3D phase space gives a **numerical approximation** of the attractor. One sees the familiar \u201cbutterfly\u201d shape with intricate laminar folds.  \n  3. You can also approximate the **invariant measure** on that attractor by running a single trajectory for a very long time, sampling points, and binning them in a 3D histogram.\n\nHowever, all such methods yield **empirical, finite-resolution** approximations. The fractal structure only emerges fully in the **infinite-time** and **infinitely fine scale** limit.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **The Lorenz attractor\u2019s support is fractal**, not a smooth 2D manifold.  \n2. **Where probability (measure) is > 0** in the long-term limit is essentially the attractor itself\u2014a fractal subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).  \n3. **No closed-form or PDE-based equation** for that fractal set is known (nor expected).  \n4. We rely on **numerical integration** and **visualization** to approximate it.  \n\nThus, if you want \u201cthe region where the system actually lives\u201d in the infinite-time limit, you get a fractal (strange) attractor with dimension strictly above 2 but below 3, supported by a singular measure. It is not describable by a single, neat analytic surface equation."

              "Below is a short derivation of the **deterministic (drift) part** of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation, showing how the **advection** and **dissipation** (or volume-change) terms appear in the evolution of the phase-space density.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Starting Point: Continuity (or Liouville) Equation\n\nConsider a phase-space density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) (sometimes denoted \\(p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\)), where \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a point in phase space.  Let the deterministic flow (or \u201cdrift\u201d) in this space be governed by  \n\\[\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}).\n\\]\n\nIn the **absence** of diffusion/noise, the evolution of \\(\\rho\\) is given by the **continuity equation** (a special case of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation with diffusion \\(D=0\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}\n= -\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\Bigl[\\rho(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\,\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\Bigr].\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nThis states that the *local rate of change* of density is determined by the *net flux* of density out of (or into) a small volume, where \\(\\rho\\,\\mathbf{f}\\) is the flux.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Splitting into Two Terms: Advection and \u201cDissipation\u201d\n\nWe can decompose the right-hand side by using the product rule for divergence:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[\\rho \\,\\mathbf{f}\\bigr]\n= \\bigl(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}\\bigr)\\,\\rho\n  + \\mathbf{f} \\cdot \\bigl(\\nabla \\rho \\bigr).\n\\]\n\nSubstitute back into \\(\\,\\partial\\rho/\\partial t = -\\,\\nabla\\cdot[\\rho\\,\\mathbf{f}]\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}\n= -\\,\\Bigl[\n      \\rho\\,\\bigl(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}\\bigr) \n      \\;+\\;\n      \\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla \\rho\n    \\Bigr].\n\\]\n\nRewriting,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}\n= -\\,\\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla \\rho\n\\;-\\;\n\\rho\\,(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}).\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n### Interpretation of the Two Terms\n\n1. **Advection term**:  \n   \\(-\\,\\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla \\rho\\)  \n   - This represents the *convective* or *advective* transport of the density \\(\\rho\\) along the velocity field \\(\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\).  \n   - If \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) simply \u201ccarries\u201d the distribution without locally compressing or expanding it, this would be the only term.\n\n2. **Dissipation (volume-change) term**:  \n   \\(-\\,\\rho\\,(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f})\\)  \n   - This term captures **local compression** or **expansion** of volume in phase space.  \n   - If \\(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{f} < 0\\) (on average), the flow is dissipative: volumes shrink in phase space, and density tends to grow along those trajectories.  \n   - In contrast, for a Hamiltonian system, \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = 0\\), which is Liouville\u2019s theorem (incompressible flow in phase space). Then this term vanishes, and \\(\\rho\\) evolves purely by advection (i.e., no net compression/expansion).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Relation to the Fokker\u2013Planck Equation\n\nIn general, the **Fokker\u2013Planck equation** in \\(d\\)-dimensional phase space (or state space) has the form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}\n= -\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[\\rho\\,\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr]\n  \\;+\\;\n  \\nabla \\cdot \\Bigl[\n    \\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\nabla \\rho\n  \\Bigr],\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is a (possibly position-dependent) diffusion tensor. The first term on the right side is precisely the **deterministic part** we just derived. When diffusion is **absent** (\\(\\mathbf{D}=0\\)), we recover equation \\(\\,(1)\\).\n\nThus, for the **deterministic** (drift-only) dynamics:\n\n1. **Advection**: \\(\\,-\\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla \\rho\\)  \n2. **Dissipation / Volume-Change**: \\(\\,-\\rho\\,(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{f})\\)\n\nThese two pieces comprise the total rate of change of \\(\\rho\\).\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- The **deterministic part** of the Fokker\u2013Planck (or Liouville) equation is essentially the **continuity equation**:\n  \\[\n    \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}\n    = -\\,\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\,\\mathbf{f}).\n  \\]\n- **Expanding** gives two contributions:\n  1. **Advection** \\(\\,-\\,\\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla \\rho\\),\n  2. **Dissipation / compression** \\(\\,-\\,\\rho\\,(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f})\\).  \n- If the flow is **incompressible** (\\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = 0\\)), only the advective term remains.  \n- For **dissipative** flows (\\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} < 0\\) on average), the density can concentrate onto lower-dimensional subsets (e.g., strange attractors in chaotic systems)."

The Role of the Continuity Equation\n\nThe **continuity equation** (or drift\u2010only Fokker\u2013Planck) in 3D reads:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} \\;=\\;\n-\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[p\\,\\mathbf{f}\\bigr] \n\\;=\\;\n-\\;\\Bigl(\\mathbf{f}\\cdot\\nabla p\\Bigr) \n-\\; p\\,\\bigl(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{f}\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nFor the Lorenz system, we have \\(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{f} = -(\\sigma + 1 + b)\\), which is a **negative constant**. Substituting, the equation becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} \n\\;=\\;\n-\\;\\Bigl[ \\mathbf{f}\\cdot\\nabla p \\Bigr]\n\\;+\\;\n(\\sigma + 1 + b)\\,p.\n\\]\n\nThat last term is indeed **positive**. The question is: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t \\(p\\) blow up?\u201d \n\n---\n\n## 2. Total Probability is Conserved\n\nRemember that \\(p\\) is a **probability density** in phase space. Its integral over all of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) is 1 (assuming we started normalized). The **continuity equation** ensures *global* conservation of probability:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\,\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\,d\\mathbf{x} \n\\;=\\;\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\\, d\\mathbf{x}\n\\;=\\;\n-\\;\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\nabla \\cdot \\bigl(p\\,\\mathbf{f}\\bigr)\\,d\\mathbf{x}.\n\\]\n\nIf we assume that \\(p\\,\\mathbf{f} \\to \\mathbf{0}\\) sufficiently fast at the boundary (e.g., at large \\(\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|\\)), then the divergence theorem implies the net flux across the boundary is zero, so\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\,d\\mathbf{x} \\;=\\; 0 \n\\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\;\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\,d\\mathbf{x} \\;=\\; 1\\;\\;(\\text{constant in time}).\n\\]\n\nThus, although locally the density can increase due to the positive term, globally there must be compensating transport (advection) that *prevents* unbounded growth. The flow \u201cconcentrates\u201d the distribution in some regions, but the total integral remains finite and normalized.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Physical Interpretation in a Dissipative System\n\n1. **Volume contraction**:  \n   Because \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} < 0\\) (on average), the **phase-space volume shrinks** under the Lorenz flow. Geometrically, this means that if you track a \u201ccloud\u201d of initial conditions, it gets folded and compressed over time, so the same *total probability* is confined to a progressively smaller region. \n\n2. **Density grows**:  \n   As a direct consequence, the local probability density \\(p\\) *increases* in those shrinking regions. That increase is exactly encoded by the positive term \\((\\sigma + 1 + b)\\,p\\).\n\n3. **No blow-up**:  \n   - The total probability (integral of \\(p\\)) is fixed at 1; it cannot exceed 1.  \n   - The \u201c+ve production\u201d from \\((\\sigma + 1 + b)\\,p\\) is exactly balanced *in the global integral* by the **outward flux** term \\(\\,-\\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla p\\).  \n   - In other words, if density tries to \u201cpile up\u201d in one location, it must be flowing *away* somewhere else, maintaining a net balance so that \\(\\int p \\,d\\mathbf{x}=1\\).\n\n4. **Long-Time Limit**:  \n   In the Lorenz system, most initial densities end up **collapsing** onto the famous **strange attractor**, where the density becomes \u201cinfinitely filamented\u201d at finer and finer scales. The mathematically *exact* limit is a **singular (fractal) measure** supported on that attractor. Nowhere does \\(p\\) blow up to infinite in finite time\u2014rather, it develops extremely thin, high-density filaments.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Analogy: Ink in a Chaotic Flow\n\nA good analogy is **ink mixing** in a fluid with a \u201cchaotic stirrer.\u201d If you start with a single blob of dye (the distribution), the flow *stretches* and *folds* it continually. Locally, concentrations become very high in the thin filaments, but the total amount of dye is still conserved. You never get \u201cinfinite dye,\u201d just finer and finer striations of high concentration. In the phase\u2010space context of the Lorenz system, the same phenomenon happens: locally large density, but no net explosion.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- The **positive \u201cdissipation\u201d term** \\((\\sigma + 1 + b)\\,p\\) reflects **volume contraction** in phase space, which increases the local density.  \n- **Probabilities remain finite** because the **continuity equation** enforces global normalization: total probability is 1, so density growth in one spot is offset by advection (outflow/inflow elsewhere).  \n- Over long times, the distribution **collapses** onto the strange attractor, becoming more and more *filamented*, but never \u201cexplodes\u201d to infinity."

              "Below is an intuitive sketch of how one **might** try to characterize (or \u201cdefine\u201d) the Lorenz (or any chaotic) attractor **from the viewpoint of the deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck/continuity equation**\u2014keeping in mind that, in practice, the usual definitions come from *dynamical-systems theory* rather than directly from PDEs.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Usual Dynamical-Systems Definition of the Attractor\n\nFrom the standard (ODE) viewpoint, the **Lorenz attractor** \\(A\\) is the (compact, invariant) set in phase space toward which *almost all* initial conditions \\(\\mathbf{x}(0)\\) in some open region converge (in practice, they converge in the sense of \\(\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\mathrm{dist}\\bigl(\\mathbf{x}(t),A\\bigr) = 0\\)).\n\nEquivalently,\n\n1. **Invariance**: once a trajectory enters \\(A\\), it never leaves.  \n2. **Attraction**: there is a \u201cbasin of attraction\u201d of initial points whose trajectories get arbitrarily close to \\(A\\) as \\(t \\to \\infty\\).  \n\nA more measure-theoretic perspective says that for almost any initial condition, the long-time behavior is \u201ccaptured\u201d by \\(A\\).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Fokker\u2013Planck (Continuity) Equation View\n\nWhen you write the deterministic Fokker\u2013Planck (a.k.a. Liouville or continuity) equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n\\;=\\;\n-\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\Bigl[p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\,\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\Bigr]\n\\;=\\;\n-\\,\\mathbf{f}\\cdot\\nabla p\n\\;-\\;\np\\,(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{f}),\n\\]\n\nand then **plug in** the Lorenz field \\(\\mathbf{f}\\), you get a PDE:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n\\;=\\;\n-\\;\\Bigl[\n     \\sigma(y - x)\\,\\partial_x p\n   \\;+\\;\n     \\bigl(x(r - z)\\;-\\;y\\bigr)\\,\\partial_y p\n   \\;+\\;\n     \\bigl(xy \\;-\\; b\\,z\\bigr)\\,\\partial_z p\n   \\Bigr]\n\\;+\\;\n(\\sigma + 1 + b)\\,p.\n\\]\n\n- The term \\((\\sigma + 1 + b)\\,p\\) is **positive**, reflecting that volume in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) is *shrinking* (dissipative flow).  \n- Meanwhile, the **advection** term \\(-\\,\\mathbf{f}\\cdot\\nabla p\\) redistributes \\(p\\) in phase space.  \n\n### 2.1. Stationary Solutions and the SRB Measure\n\nIf there were a *smooth* stationary solution \\(p_\\infty(\\mathbf{x})\\) satisfying\n\n\\[\n0 \n\\;=\\;\n-\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\bigl[p_\\infty(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\bigr]\n\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\n\\nabla\\cdot\\bigl[p_\\infty\\,\\mathbf{f}\\bigr] = 0,\n\\]\n\nyou might interpret \\(p_\\infty\\) as a \u201csteady-state density.\u201d **However**, for strongly chaotic, dissipative systems like Lorenz, the actual long-time limit of \\(p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) becomes a **singular (fractal) measure**, not a smooth function. In other words:\n\n- Formally, the \u201csteady solution\u201d to the PDE is a *delta*-like measure supported on the **strange attractor**\u2014the so-called **SRB measure**.  \n- Mathematically, it is *not* an \\(L^1\\) or \\(C^1\\) function but a distribution (in measure-theory sense).  \n\nThat measure balances the \u201cpositive dissipation term\u201d with the \u201cadvective outflow\u201d in such a way that the total probability remains 1, and all trajectories (or all \u201cmass\u201d in a distribution sense) end up \u201cliving on\u201d the fractal set \\(A\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. \u201cDefining\u201d the Attractor via the PDE\n\nThus, from a **pure PDE** standpoint, one could say:\n\n1. **Evolve** an initial smooth density \\(p_0(\\mathbf{x})\\) under  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n   \\;=\\;\n   -\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\bigl[p\\,\\mathbf{f}\\bigr],\n   \\]\n   with suitable boundary conditions (e.g., no flux at infinity).  \n2. **Observe** that as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) develops finer and finer \u201cfilaments,\u201d converging *weak-\\(** form) to a **limiting measure** \\(\\mu_\\infty\\).  \n3. The **support** of \\(\\mu_\\infty\\) (the set of points where \\(\\mu_\\infty\\) is nonzero) is precisely the **Lorenz attractor** \\(A\\).  \n\nHence, **in principle**, one might define \\(A\\) as \u201cthe minimal closed set that carries the limiting measure for almost all initial distributions.\u201d However, there\u2019s **no simple PDE** whose *level set* \\(\\{ \\mathbf{x} : F(\\mathbf{x})=0\\}\\) is the attractor; rather, the **invariant measure** (a singular solution to the continuity equation) is the PDE object that identifies \\(A\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why the Positive Dissipation Term Doesn\u2019t Make \\(p\\) Blow Up\n\nAs you noted, the local growth term \\((\\sigma + 1 + b)\\,p\\) is balanced by the advective transport \\(-\\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\nabla p\\). Globally, the total probability is conserved (remains 1), but it collapses onto a smaller and smaller volume in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). That is precisely how you get a fractal measure concentrated on the attractor. There is no \u201cexplosion\u201d in the sense of becoming infinite in open regions\u2014rather, the density becomes *infinite* on a fractal set in the limit.\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Chaotic Attractor**  \n   - Dynamically, it\u2019s the set where typical trajectories accumulate (forward invariant + attracting).  \n   - From a measure perspective, it\u2019s the **support of the singular stationary measure** (SRB measure) solving the continuity equation in the \\(t\\to\\infty\\) limit.  \n\n2. **Balance of Terms**  \n   - The **positive \u201cdissipation\u201d term** reflects contraction of volumes in phase space, which drives up local density.  \n   - **Advection** (the divergence part) redistributes probability and ensures the total integral stays 1, preventing unbounded blow-up in any open region.  \n\n3. **No Simple PDE for the Set**  \n   - You *cannot* write the attractor as \\(F(\\mathbf{x})=0\\) for some closed-form \\(F\\).  \n   - Instead, it emerges from the *iterated folding & stretching* dynamics, or equivalently from the *singular stationary solution* to the continuity equation.  \n\nThus, if you want to link the **Fokker\u2013Planck PDE viewpoint** to the **definition of the attractor**, the attractor can be viewed as the **fractal support** of the **stationary (invariant) measure** that solves the PDE in the limit \\(t \\to \\infty\\). This set is exactly where the \u201cpositive dissipation\u201d and \u201cnegative divergence\u201d balance out to give a finite (but highly concentrated) distribution."

              "In a nutshell, **the presence of (at least one) positive Lyapunov exponent**\u2014or more informally, **\u201cchaos\u201d**\u2014prevents the system from settling into a single steady state (fixed point or simple limit cycle). Below is a more detailed explanation in the context of the **Lorenz system** or other chaotic, dissipative flows:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Steady State vs. Chaotic Attractor\n\n- A **steady state** in phase space (for the ODE \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\)) usually means a **fixed point** \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) where \\(\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}^*) = \\mathbf{0}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is *globally stable*, then *every* trajectory converges to \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\).  \n- By contrast, **chaotic** systems do *not* converge to a single point or a simple limit cycle. Instead, they often have a **strange (fractal) attractor** on which trajectories move erratically forever, never settling down into a single steady configuration.\n\nIn the **Lorenz system** (for the classical parameter regime \\(\\sigma=10,\\;r=28,\\;b=\\tfrac{8}{3}\\)), there is no stable fixed point or stable limit cycle; instead, trajectories approach the **Lorenz attractor**, which is a chaotic set with sensitive dependence on initial conditions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Property: Positively Stretched Directions (Positive Lyapunov Exponent)\n\nAt the heart of chaos is the existence of an **unstable direction** in phase space\u2014meaning that if you pick two very close initial points, their trajectories separate exponentially fast in at least one direction. The **largest Lyapunov exponent** measures this exponential rate of separation; when it is positive, you have chaos.\n\n1. **Unstable manifolds** around saddles or saddle-like orbits lead to exponential divergence of nearby trajectories in some directions, even if the overall flow is dissipative (\\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} < 0\\) on average).\n\n2. **No single attracting fixed point**:  \n   - If there were a globally stable fixed point, the largest Lyapunov exponent (evaluated on that attractor) would be negative (convergence in all directions).  \n   - In the Lorenz chaotic regime, *every* equilibrium point is either unstable or a saddle, meaning trajectories cannot settle there.\n\nThus, the presence of an **unstable direction** (positive Lyapunov exponent) is the core dynamical feature preventing a simple steady state.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Dissipation Alone Does Not Guarantee a Steady State\n\nA negative divergence (\\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} < 0\\)) makes the system **dissipative**\u2014meaning volumes in phase space shrink over time. One might guess this would force all trajectories to gather at a stable steady state, but that is *not* necessarily the case. Instead, a **strange attractor** can form:\n\n- **Folding and stretching** of the flow can concentrate trajectories onto a fractal set (the strange attractor).  \n- The same mechanism that contracts volume overall can still stretch trajectories along certain directions (the unstable manifold), creating *chaos* while preventing convergence to a single point.\n\nHence, **dissipation + an unstable direction** \\(\\implies\\) a *chaotic* dissipative system.\n\n---\n\n## 4. In Terms of the Fokker\u2013Planck (Continuity) Equation\n\nFrom the **Fokker\u2013Planck** or **continuity** viewpoint (without diffusion),\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n= -\\,\\nabla \\cdot (p\\,\\mathbf{f}),\n\\]\nyou might *naively* expect that a negative divergence of \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) \u201ccompresses\u201d the probability density \\(p\\) into a smaller region and thus eventually yields a stationary, smooth density everywhere. But when the dynamics are chaotic:\n\n1. **No smooth stationary solution** (other than the trivial one that is concentrated on a fractal set).  \n2. The limit measure becomes **singular**, supported on the strange attractor.  \n3. That fractal set in phase space does *not* correspond to a fixed point or simple cycle, so the system never reaches a \u201cplain\u201d steady state in the usual sense.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **The critical property** that prevents a single steady state is the existence of **chaotic dynamics**, typically signaled by a **positive Lyapunov exponent** in at least one direction.  \n- **Dissipation** alone (negative \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}\\)) would drive phase-space volumes to contract, but coupled with a local **unstable direction** it creates a **strange attractor** rather than a stable fixed point.  \n\nThis combination\u2014**volume contraction plus one or more expanding directions**\u2014is what ensures there is no simple steady state in chaotic dissipative systems like Lorenz."

              "First, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by \u201cthe phase space density is dissipated uniformly in phase space\u201d in the context of a system like the Lorenz equations. In the Lorenz system, the divergence of the vector field \\(\\mathbf{f}(x,y,z)\\) is a **constant negative number**:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} \\;=\\; -\\,(\\sigma + 1 + b).\n\\]\n\nBecause this divergence is the same everywhere, one says the system has a **uniform rate of volume contraction** throughout phase space. Below is why this uniformity is significant.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Uniform Dissipation Means a Constant Volume Contraction Rate\n\nIn a 3D dynamical system \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\), the quantity \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}\\) represents the local rate at which volumes in phase space are expanding or contracting. If \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\text{constant} < 0\\), then *everywhere* in phase space, there is the *same* instantaneous rate of volume shrinkage.  \n\n- **No special regions**: There is no location singled out for \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless\u201d contraction.  \n- **Global property**: The flow is \u201cdemocratically\u201d reducing volumes at every point in the same way, at least in terms of the sum of expansions and contractions in all directions.\n\nIn many other dissipative systems, \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\) can vary with \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), so the local rate of volume change depends on where you are in phase space. The Lorenz equations are simpler (and more symmetric) in that regard.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why Probability Doesn\u2019t \u201cExplode,\u201d Even with Uniform Dissipation\n\nA common puzzle is how the continuity (Fokker\u2013Planck) equation can have a **positive** production term (proportional to \\(\\lvert \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} \\rvert\\, p\\)) and still not blow up the density \\(p\\). The key is:\n\n1. **Global conservation of total probability**:  \n   The continuity equation ensures the *integral* of the density over all phase space stays constant (e.g., remains 1), so growth of density in one region must be balanced by **advective transport** out of that region (the \\(-\\,\\mathbf{f}\\cdot\\nabla p\\) term).\n\n2. **Collapsing onto a lower-dimensional attractor**:  \n   Even though phase-space volumes contract everywhere, trajectories do not all coalesce to a single point; instead, they stretch in some unstable direction(s), fold, and eventually form a **strange attractor**. The \u201cuniform dissipation\u201d is one ingredient that helps create a fractal set (the Lorenz attractor) on which the probability becomes concentrated in the infinite-time limit.\n\nHence, uniform dissipation plus an unstable manifold direction leads to **chaos** rather than a stable, trivial steady state.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Significance for the Structure of the Attractor\n\nBecause the volume contraction rate is the same throughout phase space, the system:\n\n1. **Has a single global \u201cspeed of dissipation.\u201d**  \n   This global negativity of \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}\\) simplifies certain theoretical analyses\u2014there\u2019s no location-dependent variation to track.\n\n2. **Highlights the \u201cstretch-and-fold\u201d mechanism** of chaos.  \n   Even though there is a uniform overall contraction, chaos still arises if at least one direction expands (positive Lyapunov exponent), while other directions contract sufficiently to keep \\(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{f}\\) negative.  \n\n3. **Facilitates the emergence of a fractal (strange) attractor.**  \n   The entire flow is \u201cpulling\u201d trajectories inward at the same net rate, but that doesn\u2019t force them all to the same point. Instead, they settle onto the butterfly-shaped Lorenz attractor, where there is indefinite \u201cwandering\u201d in a complicated set.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Physical / Modeling Insight\n\nIn modeling terms (e.g., Lorenz\u2019s original derivation from fluid convection), having a **constant negative divergence** is a consequence of truncating and simplifying more complicated PDEs (like the Navier\u2013Stokes equations under certain approximations). It says, in effect, that **the energy (or volume) is drained from the system at a uniform rate**. That\u2019s simpler than having a position- or velocity-dependent damping term, yet still enough to capture the essential chaos of real dissipative systems.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Uniform (constant) negative divergence** \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}\\) implies a *global* and *even* rate of phase-space volume contraction.  \n- This does **not** mean the system goes to a single stable fixed point; rather, with one or more unstable directions, it can develop **chaos** and a **strange attractor**.  \n- **Significance**: it simplifies some analyses and clarifies that **no part** of phase space is favored or disfavored for contraction, yet the interplay of contraction and expansion in different directions still yields richly chaotic behavior."

              "First, let\u2019s restate the scenario a bit more precisely:\n\nYou have a functional\n\\[\nF[A] \\;=\\; \\int d^nx\\,f\\bigl(A(x), \\partial_\\mu A(x), \\dots\\bigr)\\,,\n\\]\nwhere \\(f\\) is some function (often called the \u201cLagrangian\u201d in physics contexts), and \\(A(x)\\) is the field on which the functional depends. Then you look at the functional derivative\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(y)} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta A(y)} \\int d^nx\\,f\\bigl(A(x)\\bigr).\n\\]\n\n### What does a \u201clarge\u201d functional derivative mean?\n\nRoughly speaking, the functional derivative \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(y)}\\) measures how sensitively \\(F[A]\\) changes under small variations of \\(A\\) at the point \\(y\\). More precisely, if you make a small variation \\(\\delta A(x)\\) around \\(x = y\\), then to first order,\n\n\\[\n\\delta F \\;\\approx\\; \\int d^nx\\, \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)} \\,\\delta A(x).\n\\]\n\nIf \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(y)}\\) is very large (in absolute value) at some point \\(y\\), it means that *for variations \\(\\delta A(x)\\) that are \u201caligned\u201d with the functional derivative at \\(y\\)*, the change \\(\\delta F\\) will be large. \n\nIn a hand-waving sense:\n\n- **Yes**, if \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(y)}\\) is large, that implies the functional is *very sensitive* to small changes in \\(A(x)\\) near \\(x = y\\).\n- **No**, it does **not** necessarily mean that *any arbitrary* small change of \\(A(x)\\) will produce a large change in \\(F\\). One must consider both the magnitude **and** the \u201cdirection\u201d of the variation \\(\\delta A(x)\\) in function space.\n\nMoreover, the sign of \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(y)}\\) matters as well\u2014it tells you whether an infinitesimal change in \\(A\\) at \\(y\\) *increases* or *decreases* the functional \\(F[A]\\). A large positive value means that if you increase \\(A(y)\\) slightly, \\(F\\) will increase significantly; a large negative value implies the opposite.\n\n### Is it an oversimplification to say \u201ca small change in \\(A\\) increases \\(f\\) a lot\u201d?\n\n- In a *loose*, qualitative sense, you could say that a large functional derivative means the functional is \u201csteep\u201d at that point in field space. \n- However, it is indeed somewhat of an oversimplification. Mathematically, you have to consider how \\(\\delta A(x)\\) and \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)}\\) interact *under the integral* \n  \\[\n    \\delta F \\;=\\; \\int d^nx\\,\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)}\\,\\delta A(x).\n  \\]\n- You only get a large \\(\\delta F\\) if the variation \\(\\delta A(x)\\) \u201caligns\u201d with where \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)}\\) is large. If you pick a variation \\(\\delta A(x)\\) that is nonzero where \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(x)}\\) is small (or has the opposite sign in some places), the net effect could still be small.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA large \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta A(y)}\\) at a point \\(y\\) indeed signifies high sensitivity of the functional \\(F[A]\\) to changes in \\(A\\) at \\(y\\). However, it is slightly oversimplified to say *any* small change in \\(A\\) will greatly increase (or decrease) \\(F\\). One must consider both the direction and location of the variation \\(\\delta A\\) in the full domain, as well as the sign of the functional derivative."

We will ignore the line \n\n```python\nU = torch.fft.ifft2(torch.fft.fft2(A) * K_fft).real\n```\n\nin `poly_growth`, since you noted we only need to check the derivative of the \u201cinner\u201d expression with respect to \\(U\\).\n\n---\n\n## 1. The function \\(\\text{poly\\_growth}\\)\n\nFrom your code:\n\n```python\ndef poly_growth(A, m=m, s=s):\n    U = ...\n    G = torch.maximum(torch.tensor(0), 1 - ((U-m)/s)**2 / 9 )**4 * 2 - 1\n    return (G+1)/2\n```\n\nLet \n\\[\nx = \\frac{U - m}{s}, \n\\quad\nH(U) = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{9} = 1 - \\frac{(U - m)^2}{9\\,s^2}.\n\\]\n\nThen \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nG(U) \n&= 2\\,\\bigl[\\max(0,\\,H(U))^4\\bigr] \\;-\\; 1,\\\\\nT(U) \n&= \\frac{G(U) + 1}{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nBut observe:\n\n\\[\nG(U) + 1 \n= 2 \\,\\bigl[\\max(0,\\,H(U))^4\\bigr] - 1 + 1 \n= 2 \\,\\max(0,\\,H(U))^4.\n\\]\n\nHence\n\n\\[\nT(U) \n= \\frac{2 \\,\\max(0,\\,H(U))^4}{2} \n= \\max(0,\\,H(U))^4.\n\\]\n\nIn other words, **the returned quantity** from `poly_growth` is\n\n\\[\nT(U) \\;=\\; \\max\\bigl(0,\\,1 - \\tfrac{(U-m)^2}{9\\,s^2}\\bigr)^{4}.\n\\]\n\nSo (ignoring the region where \\(H(U)\\le 0\\)) the function is\n\n\\[\nT(U) \\;=\\; \\bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\bigr)^4\n\\quad\\text{with }x = \\tfrac{U - m}{s}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Let us break it down:\n\n1.  Inside the region \\(\\{\\,H(U) > 0\\}\\), i.e. \\(1 - \\frac{x^2}{9} > 0\\):\n\n    \\[\n    \\frac{dT}{dx} \n    = \\frac{d}{dx}\\Bigl[\\bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\bigr)^4\\Bigr] \n    = 4 \\,\\bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\bigr)^3 \\;\\cdot\\; \\frac{d}{dx}\\Bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\Bigr).\n    \\]\n\n    But \n    \\[\n    \\frac{d}{dx}\\Bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\Bigr) \n    = -\\tfrac{2x}{9}.\n    \\]\n    Therefore\n    \\[\n    \\frac{dT}{dx} \n    = 4\\,\\bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\bigr)^3 \\;\\cdot\\;\\bigl(-\\tfrac{2x}{9}\\bigr) \n    = -\\tfrac{8x}{9} \\,\\bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\bigr)^3.\n    \\]\n\n2.  By the chain rule, \n    \\[\n    \\frac{dT}{dU} \n    \\;=\\; \\frac{dT}{dx}\\cdot \\frac{dx}{dU}\n    \\;=\\; \\Bigl[-\\tfrac{8x}{9} \\,\\bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\bigr)^3\\Bigr] \\;\\times\\;\\tfrac{1}{s}.\n    \\]\n    Hence\n    \\[\n    \\boxed{\n      \\frac{dT}{dU}\n      = \n      -\\tfrac{8}{9\\,s}\\,x \\,\\bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\bigr)^3\n      \\quad\\text{for}\\quad 1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9} > 0,\n    }\n    \\]\n    and \\(0\\) otherwise.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Comparing with your code\n\nYour `poly_growth_prime` function is:\n\n```python\ndef poly_growth_prime(U, m=m, s=s):\n    x = (U-m)/s\n    mask = 1 - x**2/9 > 0\n    derivative = torch.where(\n        mask,\n        -8/9 * x * (1 - x**2/9)**3,\n        torch.zeros_like(U)\n    )\n    return derivative\n```\n\n### The missing factor of \\(\\tfrac{1}{s}\\)\n\nNotice that your code has\n\n\\[\n- \\tfrac{8}{9}\\,x\\,\\bigl(1 - \\tfrac{x^2}{9}\\bigr)^3\n\\]\n\n**but** does **not** multiply by \\(\\frac{1}{s}\\).  \n\nMathematically, \n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dU}\\Bigl(\\max(0, 1 - \\tfrac{(U-m)^2}{9s^2})^4\\Bigr)\n\\]\nrequires an extra factor of \\(\\tfrac{1}{s}\\) from the chain rule, because \\(x = \\frac{U-m}{s}\\).  In other words, your code as written computes\n\n\\(\\tfrac{dT}{dx}\\), \n\nnot \n\n\\(\\tfrac{dT}{dU}\\).\n\n---\n\n## 4. The correct derivative\n\nTherefore, if the intent is truly **dT/dU**, the correct implementation should be:\n\n```python\ndef poly_growth_prime(U, m=m, s=s):\n    x = (U-m)/s\n    mask = (1 - x**2/9) > 0\n    derivative = torch.where(\n        mask,\n        -8/(9*s) * x * (1 - x**2/9)**3,   # note the 1/s factor!\n        torch.zeros_like(U)\n    )\n    return derivative\n```\n\nAll other details (e.g. the sign, the power, the piecewise zeroing when the mask is false) are correct, but **the factor \\(\\frac{1}{s}\\) is missing** from your current code.\n\n---\n\n# Short Answer\n\n**No,** the current `poly_growth_prime` is missing the chain\u2010rule factor of \\(\\tfrac{1}{s}\\).  The code as is computes \\(\\tfrac{d}{dx}\\), but you asked for \\(\\tfrac{d}{dU}\\).  To fix it, just multiply by \\(\\tfrac{1}{s}\\):\n\n```python\nderivative = torch.where(\n    mask,\n    -8/(9*s) * x * (1 - x**2/9)**3,\n    torch.zeros_like(U)\n)\n```"

              "In quantum mechanics and quantum information, the notation \\(\\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert 1 \\rangle\\) refers to two orthogonal \u201cbasis states\u201d of a qubit (or a two-level quantum system). These kets are shorthand for abstract vectors in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, but they can certainly be expressed as concrete wavefunctions if you specify the physical system you have in mind.\n\n---\n\n## Abstract vector form\n\nIn the most common convention (computational basis),\n\n\\[\n\\lvert 0 \\rangle \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n,\\quad\n\\lvert 1 \\rangle \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert 1 \\rangle\\) are just two orthogonal vectors (unit vectors) in a two-dimensional complex vector space.\n\n---\n\n## Concrete wavefunction form\n\nWhen you talk about the *wavefunction* of a physical system, you typically have a continuous function \\(\\psi(x)\\) (in position space) or \\(\\phi(p)\\) (in momentum space), etc. For a two-level system, these basis states can indeed have wavefunction representations. For example:\n\n1. **Spin-\\(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\) system:**\n   - \\(\\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) might be the spin \u201cup\u201d state \\(\\lvert \\!\\uparrow \\rangle\\),\n   - \\(\\lvert 1 \\rangle\\) might be the spin \u201cdown\u201d state \\(\\lvert \\!\\downarrow \\rangle\\).\n\n   In position representation, these aren\u2019t typically expressed as \\(\\psi(x)\\) because spin isn\u2019t a spatial degree of freedom; rather, each of these states is *independent* of \\(x\\). Mathematically, you could write them as something like\n   \\[\n   \\lvert 0 \\rangle \\equiv \\lvert \\!\\uparrow \\rangle \\quad,\\quad\n   \\lvert 1 \\rangle \\equiv \\lvert \\!\\downarrow \\rangle,\n   \\]\n   where each is a discrete internal state (spin) rather than a function of position.\n\n2. **Two-level atom:**\n   - \\(\\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) can be the atom\u2019s ground electronic state,\n   - \\(\\lvert 1 \\rangle\\) can be the atom\u2019s first excited electronic state.\n\n   In that case, each state corresponds to a specific *wavefunction* solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (i.e., an orbital), so \\(\\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert 1 \\rangle\\) are literally the first two energy eigenstates \\(\\psi_0(\\mathbf{r})\\) and \\(\\psi_1(\\mathbf{r})\\). \n\n3. **Photon polarization:**\n   - \\(\\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) might be horizontal polarization \\(\\lvert H \\rangle\\),\n   - \\(\\lvert 1 \\rangle\\) might be vertical polarization \\(\\lvert V \\rangle\\).\n\n   Here, the wavefunction is in the polarization (internal) degree of freedom, rather than in position space.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- **\\(\\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert 1 \\rangle\\)** are abstract basis vectors in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, serving as the standard (computational) basis in quantum information theory.\n- Whether they \u201ccorrespond to a concrete wavefunction\u201d depends on which physical realization or interpretation you are using:\n  - In spin systems, they are the spin-up and spin-down states.\n  - In two-level atoms, they are energy eigenstates (with corresponding orbital wavefunctions).\n  - In photon polarization, they are orthogonal polarization states.\n- The bra\u2013ket notation does not by itself describe the shape of a wavefunction in position or momentum space but can be connected to a wavefunction once you specify the physical system and its mode of representation."
