              "In chaotic dynamical systems, both Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy and fractal (or attractor) dimension provide ways of quantifying complexity, but they do so in different ways:\n\n1. **Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy**  \n   KS entropy measures the average rate at which a system produces new information\u2014that is, how unpredictable its trajectories are. For many smooth dynamical systems, Pesin\u2019s theorem tells us that the KS entropy is equal to the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents:\n   \\[\n   h_{KS} = \\sum_{\\lambda_i > 0} \\lambda_i.\n   \\]\n   This means that the faster nearby trajectories diverge (i.e., the larger the positive Lyapunov exponents), the higher the entropy and the more \u201cchaotic\u201d the system.\n\n2. **Fractal Dimension**  \n   Fractal dimension, such as the Hausdorff dimension or the Kaplan\u2013Yorke (Lyapunov) dimension, quantifies how an attractor fills the phase space. The Kaplan\u2013Yorke formula, for example, uses the Lyapunov exponents to estimate the effective dimension of the attractor:\n   \\[\n   D_{KY} = j + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{j} \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{j+1}|},\n   \\]\n   where \\( j \\) is the largest integer such that the sum of the first \\( j \\) Lyapunov exponents is non-negative. This formula connects the rate of divergence of trajectories with the geometric complexity of the attractor.\n\n3. **The Relationship**  \n   The link between the two measures arises because both depend on the Lyapunov spectrum:\n   - **Indirect Connection via Lyapunov Exponents:** Since KS entropy is determined by the positive Lyapunov exponents and the Kaplan\u2013Yorke formula for fractal dimension also uses these exponents, both quantities reflect how sensitive the system is to initial conditions.\n   - **Implications:** Generally, a system with higher KS entropy tends to have a more complex (often higher-dimensional) attractor. However, there isn\u2019t a simple universal formula that expresses fractal dimension directly in terms of KS entropy. Instead, their relationship is mediated by the underlying Lyapunov exponents.\n\n4. **Additional Considerations**  \n   In some studies, further refined relations (for example, involving local entropy and local dimensions) have been developed, but these are typically system-specific and rely on additional assumptions about the dynamics (like hyperbolicity).\n\nIn summary, while KS entropy measures the rate of information production (and thus unpredictability) and fractal dimension measures the geometric complexity of the attractor, both are fundamentally linked through the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. This connection means that systems with high entropy often exhibit attractors with higher fractal dimensions, reflecting their rich, intricate structure."

              "In Hamiltonian systems, the dynamics are governed by equations that preserve phase space volume\u2014a property known as Liouville\u2019s theorem. As a result, if you follow the exact (fine\u2010grained) probability density \\(\\rho(x)\\) in phase space, the Gibbs entropy\n\n\\[\nS_G = -k_B \\int \\rho(x) \\ln \\rho(x) \\, d\\Gamma\n\\]\n\nremains constant over time. Any apparent increase in entropy in such systems usually arises from a coarse-grained perspective, where one averages or bins the phase space into finite regions, thereby losing some detailed information.\n\nIn contrast, non-Hamiltonian systems\u2014especially those that are dissipative\u2014do not conserve phase space volume. This non-conservation is typically expressed by a nonzero divergence of the flow field, \\(\\nabla \\cdot f(x) \\neq 0\\), where the dynamics are given by \\(\\dot{x} = f(x)\\). Here\u2019s how that affects the Gibbs entropy:\n\n1. **Phase Space Contraction or Expansion:**  \n   In many non-Hamiltonian systems, such as those with friction or external driving forces, the phase space volume may contract (or sometimes expand). This contraction implies that the probability density \\(\\rho(x)\\) becomes more concentrated over time, often leading to a decrease in the fine\u2010grained Gibbs entropy. In effect, the system loses \u201cvolume\u201d in phase space as it evolves, which can be interpreted as a kind of entropy production or dissipation.\n\n2. **Time Evolution and the Liouville Equation:**  \n   The evolution of the density is governed by a modified Liouville equation:\n   \\[\n   \\partial_t \\rho(x) = - \\nabla \\cdot [f(x) \\rho(x)].\n   \\]\n   When you compute the time derivative of the Gibbs entropy for a non-Hamiltonian system, you encounter contributions from the divergence of \\(f(x)\\). In Hamiltonian systems (\\(\\nabla \\cdot f(x)=0\\)), these contributions vanish, keeping \\(S_G\\) constant. However, for non-Hamiltonian dynamics, these contributions lead to a nonzero \\(\\frac{dS_G}{dt}\\), reflecting the evolving \u201cdisorder\u201d or information content of the system.\n\n3. **Invariant Measures and Attractors:**  \n   Many dissipative non-Hamiltonian systems evolve toward strange attractors with fractal structures. The invariant measures for such attractors are often singular with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure (the usual notion of volume in phase space). In these cases, the standard Gibbs entropy can become ill-defined or divergent if not handled with care\u2014often necessitating a coarse-graining approach to yield a finite, meaningful value.\n\n4. **Entropy Production:**  \n   In non-Hamiltonian systems, the change in Gibbs entropy is sometimes directly linked to the rate of phase space contraction, which can serve as a measure of entropy production. For example, in thermostatted dynamics (such as those modeled by the Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover thermostat), one often relates the contraction rate to thermodynamic entropy production, providing insight into the system\u2019s irreversible behavior.\n\n**Summary Comparison:**\n\n- **Hamiltonian Systems:**  \n  - **Phase Space:** Volume-preserving (Liouville\u2019s theorem holds).  \n  - **Gibbs Entropy:** Remains constant over time (for the fine-grained density).  \n  - **Implications:** Any observed increase in entropy arises only from coarse-graining or external perturbations.\n\n- **Non-Hamiltonian Systems:**  \n  - **Phase Space:** Not volume-preserving; can contract or expand.  \n  - **Gibbs Entropy:** Generally changes over time (typically decreases in dissipative systems), reflecting the system\u2019s evolving structure and irreversibility.  \n  - **Implications:** The changing entropy is linked to physical processes like dissipation and the formation of attractors, with the phase space contraction rate often providing a quantitative measure of entropy production.\n\nThus, while the mathematical form of the Gibbs entropy is the same, its physical interpretation and time evolution differ markedly between Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian systems due to the conservation (or non-conservation) of phase space volume."

              "Yes, entropy plays a key role in several predictive frameworks in both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian systems, though its role and interpretation can differ.\n\n### In Hamiltonian Systems\n\n- **Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics:**  \n  In Hamiltonian systems, even though the fine\u2010grained Gibbs entropy (computed with the exact phase space density) remains constant due to Liouville\u2019s theorem, a coarse-grained version of the entropy is often used. By partitioning phase space into finite cells, one can observe an effective increase in entropy, which underlies the second law of thermodynamics. The Maximum Entropy Principle, which selects the equilibrium probability distribution by maximizing entropy subject to certain constraints (like fixed energy), is central in predicting equilibrium properties.\n\n- **Ergodic Theory and KS Entropy:**  \n  In chaotic Hamiltonian systems, the Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy\u2014related to the sum of positive Lyapunov exponents\u2014is used to characterize the rate at which information about the system\u2019s initial conditions is lost. This measure of unpredictability can help predict the effective \u201cpredictability horizon\u201d for a system, even though the fine-grained Gibbs entropy itself is constant.\n\n### In Non-Hamiltonian (Dissipative) Systems\n\n- **Entropy Production and Irreversibility:**  \n  For dissipative systems where phase space volume is not conserved, the rate of entropy production (or, equivalently, phase space contraction) becomes a crucial quantity. This entropy production is directly linked to irreversible processes. In many cases, measuring the contraction rate helps predict how a system will relax to a steady state or evolve toward a strange attractor. This is fundamental in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.\n\n- **Fluctuation Theorems and Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics:**  \n  Modern theories like the Evans-Searles fluctuation theorem and the Gallavotti-Cohen theorem rely on the concept of entropy production to predict the statistical properties of fluctuations in systems far from equilibrium. These theorems provide predictions about the probabilities of transient violations of the second law and are key in understanding small-system thermodynamics and nanoscale processes.\n\n### Summary of Predictive Roles\n\n- **Hamiltonian Systems:**  \n  Although the fine-grained entropy does not change, the concept of entropy\u2014when combined with coarse-graining or through related measures like KS entropy\u2014helps predict equilibrium states and the dynamical loss of information, thereby providing a basis for understanding thermalization and chaos.\n\n- **Non-Hamiltonian Systems:**  \n  The rate of entropy production is used to predict the behavior of dissipative processes, such as how systems evolve toward steady states or attractors. It also underpins fluctuation relations that have been experimentally verified in small systems.\n\nIn both cases, while the direct time evolution of Gibbs entropy may differ, the underlying concept of entropy is central to theories that predict macroscopic behavior from microscopic dynamics, whether through the equilibrium distributions derived from maximum entropy arguments or through the characterization of irreversibility and chaos in dissipative systems."

              "Depth and scope: I want to know what is considered well-known, like specific results and the people that came up with these results. Connect this to open research problems and current research directions, who is working on these problems and for what applications. This should be very deep, as you should dive into concrete results and specific papers.\n\nPreferred Sources: All of the above. Prioritize established theory and dogma, but also include more interdisiciplinary applications which might be less cited.\n\nMathematical Rigor: At all costs, avoid pure math papers. These are too abstract for me and are not possible to communicate to a non-expert in pure math like myself. I am someone who uses math results, but I do not touch theorems myself. You can pull info from these sources, but be very cautious to avoid jargon and only summarize the results. Nevertheless, math is very much a requirement in your explanation. I am extremely competent with applications of advanced mathematics and even physics, but I draw the line at theorems and lemmas and abstract algebras. In short, find lots of math and explain in terms of math, but avoid the unnecessary details of pure math.\n\nSpecific applications: Physics (e.g. ginzburg landau theory, QIT, information theory as it applies to thermo dynamics, stat mech), Dynamical systems (chaos & stability theory, fractals), Artificial Life & (astro)Biology (e.g continuous/neural cellular automata, reaction diffusion), Computation (e.g. analog,reversible computing, universality, computational media). Focus on continuous systems over discrete ones, since discrete systems like maps lack the nuance of continuous systems.\n\nFormat: Formal academic review, but with informal readers' notes that discuss and explain concepts in more simple terms. Make sure there is a conclusion section which ties together all these ideas into a cohesive overview of the intersection of the fields."

              "# Introduction \nThe interplay between dynamical systems, information theory, and computation has become a rich interdisciplinary field. In continuous systems, fundamental equations like the **Liouville equation** (for deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics) and the **Fokker\u2013Planck equation** (for stochastic or open systems) describe the evolution of probability densities in phase space. These equations not only underpin **statistical mechanics and thermodynamics** but also reveal how information is preserved, transformed, or lost in physical processes. Moreover, nonlinear dynamics governed by such equations can exhibit complex behavior \u2013 including **chaos and fractal structures** \u2013 that challenge our notions of predictability and information content. In parallel, there is a growing recognition that **differential equations can serve as continuous analogues of algorithms**, raising profound questions about **Turing-completeness** in physics and the thermodynamic costs of computation. This review provides a deep examination of these interconnected topics, drawing on established results and key contributors across physics, mathematics, and computing. We focus on continuous systems (flows, differential equations, continuous media) rather than discrete mappings, highlighting applications to physics (thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, pattern formation, quantum information), dynamical systems theory (chaos, stability, fractals), biological and artificial life systems (reaction-diffusion **Turing patterns**, neural/continuous cellular automata), and computation (analog and reversible computing, **computational media** in physical substrates). Throughout, we use **\u2013\u202flog\u202f\u03c1** (the negative logarithm of phase-space density) as a guiding measure of information content, and treat the flow of probability under dynamics as an \u201cadvection of information.\u201d We begin with the role of Liouville and Fokker\u2013Planck equations in linking dynamics with information and thermodynamics, then explore fractal structures and chaos emerging from these flows. Next, we examine how the divergence of a flow relates to information creation or erasure, and why \u2013\u202flog\u202f\u03c1 serves as a natural information metric. We then generalize these concepts to discuss information processing in dynamical systems and computation, before finally considering how continuous dynamical equations can implement algorithms, up to Turing-universal computation. A concluding section synthesizes the insights and highlights open research directions at this frontier of \u201cinformation dynamics.\u201d\n\n## Liouville and Fokker\u2013Planck Equations in Information Theory and Thermodynamics  \n**Liouville\u2019s equation** governs the evolution of a probability density \u03c1(x,t) in phase space under deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics. It can be written as a continuity equation $\\partial_t \\rho + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho \\mathbf{v})=0$, where $\\mathbf{v}(x)$ is the phase-space velocity given by the system\u2019s equations of motion. A crucial property is that Hamiltonian flows are **incompressible** in phase space \u2013 their divergence $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{v}=0$ \u2013 which implies **Liouville\u2019s theorem:** the phase space volume of any material element (and hence any probability mass) is preserved in time\u30106\u2020L290-L298\u3011. Consequently, the Liouville equation implies **constant phase-space density along trajectories** (if the flow is incompressible) and conserves the fine-grained Gibbs entropy $S_{\\text{Gibbs}} = -k_B \\int \\rho \\ln\\rho\\,d^n x$ (where $k_B$ is Boltzmann\u2019s constant) for an isolated system. In information-theoretic terms, no information is lost or gained in an ideal Hamiltonian system \u2013 the uncertainty (Shannon entropy) about the state remains constant as the distribution just gets convected in phase space. This seemingly contradicts the macroscopic **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, which demands entropy increase, but the resolution lies in coarse-graining and irreversibility: while the **fine-grained entropy** stays constant, any finite-resolution observation effectively coarse-grains the distribution, and as a Hamiltonian system evolves mixing chaotic motions, $\\rho(x,t)$ develops intricate filaments that increase the **coarse-grained entropy**\u301019\u2020L4-L12\u3011. Thus Liouville\u2019s equation provides a microscopic, **reversible** baseline where information (in the Shannon sense) is conserved, and entropy increase is understood as an emergent, observer-dependent phenomenon (arising when fine details become irrelevant or lost to unresolved degrees of freedom).\n\nBy contrast, the **Fokker\u2013Planck equation** (FPE) introduces irreversible dynamics by accounting for diffusion and dissipation. In its simplest form, the FPE for a probability density $\\rho(x,t)$ may be written as $\\partial_t \\rho = -\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{A}(x)\\rho) + D\\nabla^2 \\rho$ (for some drift $\\mathbf{A}(x)$ and diffusion coefficient $D$). The FPE is widely used in statistical physics to describe systems in contact with a heat bath (Brownian motion, Langevin dynamics, etc.), and it ensures that solutions evolve toward an equilibrium distribution (e.g. a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution) that maximizes entropy. In fact, many Fokker\u2013Planck systems satisfy an **H-theorem**: the **Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence** (relative entropy) or the Shannon entropy $H = -\\int \\rho \\ln \\rho\\,dx$ tends to increase (or the free-energy functional decreases) over time, approaching a maximum at equilibrium. Recent work has formalized this: for example, in *stochastic thermodynamics*, one can define non-equilibrium free energy and show it serves as a Lyapunov function for the Fokker\u2013Planck evolution\u30108\u2020L9-L18\u3011\u30108\u2020L13-L20\u3011. Falasco *et al.* (2018) build a rigorous thermodynamic description of reaction-diffusion systems (a class described by Fokker\u2013Planck-type equations in continuum) and show that the **non-equilibrium free energy** (which includes an entropy term $-\\int \\rho\\ln\\rho$) always decreases as the system relaxes, providing the minimum work needed to manipulate concentrations\u30108\u2020L11-L19\u3011. In closed systems this reproduces the second law of thermodynamics (entropy can only increase or stay constant), while in open systems the free energy decrease quantifies dissipated work. This framework treats the emergence of order (such as chemical **Turing patterns**, discussed later) as a thermodynamic phase transition, and indeed Falasco *et al.* classify the onset of a Turing pattern in a reaction-diffusion model as a genuine **nonequilibrium phase transition** using these entropy/information measures\u301036\u2020L1-L4\u3011.\n\nFrom an **information theory** perspective, the Fokker\u2013Planck equation describes how **uncertainty** about the system\u2019s state evolves in time under the influence of both deterministic drifts and random fluctuations. The term $-\\,\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{A}\\rho)$ is an advection (like Liouville\u2019s term) that by itself would preserve entropy, whereas the diffusion term $D\\nabla^2 \\rho$ tends to spread the distribution and **increase entropy (information entropy)** over time. For example, if one starts with a localized distribution (low entropy, high information about the state), pure diffusion will broaden it, increasing $-\\int \\rho\\ln\\rho$. In equilibrium, the stationary solution $\\rho_{\\text{eq}}(x)$ often takes the Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs form $\\rho_{\\text{eq}}\\propto e^{-V(x)/k_BT}$ (where $V(x)$ is an energy potential), and the quantity $- \\ln \\rho_{\\text{eq}} = V(x)/k_BT + \\text{const.}$ directly measures the *information content* (or surprise) of state $x$ relative to equilibrium. This highlights a deep connection: **physical entropy** and **information-theoretic entropy** are essentially the same concept (up to units), as first pointed out by pioneers like Edwin Jaynes. In equilibrium thermodynamics, the Gibbs/Boltzmann entropy $S = -k_B\\int \\rho \\ln \\rho$ is literally the Shannon entropy of the ensemble (with $k_B$ scaling), and maximizing entropy subject to constraints reproduces thermodynamic equilibria \u2013 a viewpoint Jaynes championed by applying information theory to statistical mechanics (1950s). Thus, the Liouville and Fokker\u2013Planck equations serve as bridges between microscopic dynamics and information measures: Liouville\u2019s equation says that an **isolated, reversible system carries constant information** (Liouville\u2019s theorem implies the Gibbs entropy is invariant\u301019\u2020L4-L12\u3011), whereas the Fokker\u2013Planck equation models **irreversible processes that increase entropy**, aligning with the second law. Any **irreversible loss of information** about the exact state (for instance, due to coarse-graining or interaction with a heat bath) corresponds to entropy production. In modern terms, **\u201cinformation is physical\u201d**, and the FPE provides a concrete way to compute the entropy/information flow in physical processes over time.\n\nBeyond thermodynamics, Liouville/Fokker\u2013Planck formalisms have found applications in **information theory and computation** as well. In control theory and signal processing, the Fokker\u2013Planck equation can describe the evolution of Bayesian probability densities as one updates knowledge of a system; entropy of $\\rho(x,t)$ quantifies uncertainty about a signal. In neuroscience and machine learning, continuous diffusion equations (Fokker\u2013Planck or diffusion processes) are used to model the flow of information in feature spaces (e.g. variational inference). There are also intriguing analogies between **reversible computing** and Liouville\u2019s equation: an ideally reversible computer (one that erases no information) would move through a state-space preserving volume, much like an incompressible flow. In fact, one can design computing systems that are **Hamiltonian** in an extended phase space to avoid entropy increase (an idea we return to under reversible computing). Meanwhile, **dissipative computing** devices (like conventional logic gates) intentionally \u201ccompress\u201d state space (many input states map to fewer output states, e.g. two inputs to one output in an AND gate), analogous to a contracting flow that increases thermodynamic entropy. These connections underscore why Liouville and Fokker\u2013Planck equations form a foundation for understanding the physics of information: they describe how probability distributions \u2013 and thereby uncertainties and information \u2013 evolve under both deterministic dynamics and stochastic influences.\n\n## Fractal Structures and Chaos Emerging from Liouville Dynamics  \nOne of the most striking outcomes of nonlinear dynamical systems governed by Liouville-type evolution is the emergence of **fractal structures** in phase space and in real-space patterns. Even though Liouville\u2019s equation is linear in $\\rho$, it is driven by the nonlinear flow $\\mathbf{v}(x)$ from the underlying ODEs, and when that flow is chaotic, the probability distribution $\\rho(x,t)$ (or material fluid density in phase space) can develop extraordinarily fine-scaled structure. **Chaos** in a dynamical system means that nearby trajectories separate exponentially (when there is a positive Lyapunov exponent), stretching and folding the phase-space distribution. Under an ideal incompressible (divergence-free) flow, this process produces a **Hamiltonian fractal mixing**: volumes are preserved but twisted into complex filaments. A classic example is a chaotic **Hamiltonian flow** (or area-preserving map) where an initial patch of density gets stretched into a long ribbon that winds through phase space, eventually becoming a **fractal filament** interwoven with others. The support of $\\rho(x,t)$ in phase space can approach a **Cantor-set-like fractal** as $t\\to\\infty$ if the system is mixing. Indeed, Smale\u2019s famous \u201chorseshoe\u201d map construction \u2013 a prototype of chaos \u2013 yields a fractal invariant set (a Cantor set) in phase space, on which the dynamics is conjugate to a Bernoulli shift\u301025\u2020L33-L41\u3011\u301025\u2020L35-L43\u3011. That horseshoe fractal is precisely the phase-space scaffold for chaotic orbits. In continuous time systems like the **Lorenz attractor** (the seminal chaotic flow discovered by Edward Lorenz in 1963), the long-term invariant measure is supported on a **strange attractor** with fractal geometry (with a Hausdorff dimension ~2.06 for Lorenz). Solutions of the Liouville equation for the Lorenz system (which would describe a distribution of an ensemble of trajectories) concentrate onto that strange attractor as $t$ grows, effectively acquiring a multifractal density supported on the attractor. Thus, chaotic dynamics naturally give rise to **fractal phase-space densities** as described by Liouville\u2019s equation.\n\nFractals also emerge from **dissipative** dynamics described by Fokker\u2013Planck-like equations, especially when combined with nonlinearity. For example, in a **dissipative chaotic system** (such as the H\u00e9non map or a damped driven pendulum), volumes contract overall, but the stretching in some directions and folding can still create a strange attractor with fractal structure. The invariant measure on a strange attractor is often a **fractal measure** \u2013 meaning if one looks at the stationary probability density $\\rho_{\\infty}(x)$ solving $\\partial_t \\rho = 0$ for the corresponding Perron\u2013Frobenius operator (discrete-time analog of Fokker\u2013Planck), it can be a singular continuous distribution with fractal support. In continuous systems, a paradigmatic example is the **R\u00f6ssler or Lorenz systems**: they are dissipative (phase-space volume contracts each cycle), and they have strange attractors with fractal dimension. The stationary distribution (as $t\\to\\infty$) for an ensemble of trajectories tends to concentrate on these attractors, which means $\\rho(x,t)$ develops **fractal singularities** (in the limit, it\u2019s not a smooth density but supported on a fractal). Even when diffusion is present (e.g. adding a small noise to a chaotic system, leading to a Fokker\u2013Planck equation), one gets a smoothened version of the fractal, but signatures of the fractal geometry (like broad multifractal spectrum or fractal correlation functions) can appear.\n\nImportantly, fractal structures are not only abstract phase-space phenomena; they often manifest as **fractal patterns in real space/time** in extended systems. The **Complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation (CGLE)** is a continuous PDE (partial differential equation) that arises as a normal form for oscillatory media and pattern formation. It is known to exhibit regimes of **spatio-temporal chaos**, such as \u201cphase chaos\u201d and \u201cdefect turbulence,\u201d which have statistical properties reminiscent of fractals\u301038\u2020L61-L69\u3011\u301038\u2020L73-L82\u3011. Aranson and Kramer\u2019s comprehensive review *The World of the Complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau Equation* (2002) documents how this single equation produces a vast variety of structures \u2013 from coherent nonlinear waves to incoherent chaotic patterns\u301037\u2020L9-L18\u3011\u301037\u2020L25-L33\u3011. In particular, CGLE can produce states of **turbulence** where coherent phase patterns break down into disordered fluctuations, and certain observables (like defect trajectories or intensity distributions) show scaling laws and fractal-like distributions. These fractal patterns are a continuous-system analog of the complex patterns seen in cellular automata. Similarly, reaction\u2013diffusion systems (which are described by partial-differential Fokker\u2013Planck-type equations for concentrations) can produce *Turing patterns* (stationary spatial mosaics like stripes and spots), and under some parameters these patterns can become labyrinthine or spotty in ways that have fractal statistical properties (e.g. lung airway patterns, chemical precipitation with fractal aggregation). While classical Turing patterns are typically periodic or quasi-periodic, certain parameter regimes or multi-species reactions can yield more disordered patchy patterns that resemble fractals.\n\nAnother important source of fractals is **turbulent fluid flows**. In high Reynolds number turbulence, the advection of dye or passive scalar by an incompressible flow (satisfying a Liouville equation for the dye concentration) leads to extremely convoluted scalar fields. The stirred dye develops filamentary structures with fractal dimensionality (often quantified by a **Lyapunov exponent for advection**). In fact, chaotic advection in fluids (as studied by Aref and Ottino in the 1980s) is a beautiful physical realization of Liouville\u2019s equation creating fractals: a blob of dye is repeatedly stretched and folded by the flow, ultimately producing a multi-scale fractal mixing pattern. The concentration field\u2019s level sets can have fractal dimension, and the probability distribution of concentration values becomes broad. These fractal structures directly relate to **information mixing**: a fluid mixing process effectively *conceals* information about initial labeling (making initial neighboring points end up far apart), which corresponds to an increase in entropy of any coarse-grained description. Yet on the fine scale, the Liouville equation ensures that if one had infinite resolution, one could still distinguish the intricate filaments (information is conserved in principle). This fine-grained distribution is an example of what is called a **SRB measure** (Sinai\u2013Ruelle\u2013Bowen measure) in chaotic dynamics \u2013 often multifractal.\n\nFractal geometry is deeply linked to **information content**. A fractal attractor or invariant measure can be characterized by various dimensions \u2013 Hausdorff dimension, correlation dimension, *information dimension* $D_1$, etc. The **information dimension** is defined using the measure\u2019s probabilities $p_i$ on finer and finer partitions: $D_1 = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0} \\frac{\\sum_i p_i \\ln p_i}{\\ln \\epsilon^{-1}}$, essentially measuring how the information (Shannon entropy) scales with scale size. For strange attractors, $D_1$ is typically less than the topological dimension, reflecting that the distribution lives on a compressed set. This relates to the concept of **Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai (KS) entropy** in ergodic theory, which quantifies the information generated by the system per unit time. In chaotic systems, the KS entropy is positive and is actually *equal* to the sum of positive Lyapunov exponents (Pesin\u2019s theorem). Intuitively, a positive KS entropy means the system\u2019s state carries an ever-increasing amount of new information as time progresses \u2013 the trajectory\u2019s path becomes more unpredictable. For Hamiltonian (volume-preserving) chaos, we have a delicate balance: fine-grained entropy remains constant (Liouville\u2019s theorem), yet the system *produces new information* in the sense that any finite-precision observer will see uncertainty grow (Shannon entropy of a coarse-grained state increases at a rate equal to the KS entropy). In dissipative chaos, some of that information is effectively lost to the environment as the system contracts onto a fractal \u2013 but the part of the state that remains (on the attractor) still can generate information/uncertainty as trajectories separate within the attractor. \n\n**Key contributors** to our understanding of fractals in dynamical systems include Benoit Mandelbrot (who coined \u201cfractal\u201d and highlighted their ubiquity in nature, including turbulence and coastlines), Edward Lorenz (discovered the first strange attractor, 1963), Yakov Sinai, David Ruelle, and Floris Takens (who in the 1970s connected strange attractors to physical turbulence). In 1991, **Cristopher Moore** demonstrated extreme forms of fractal dynamics by constructing smooth dynamical systems that simulate shift maps and even Turing machines\u301025\u2020L29-L37\u3011\u301025\u2020L33-L41\u3011. In these \u201cgeneralized shifts,\u201d the invariant set is a Cantor-like fractal carrying a coding for a Turing machine\u2019s binary tape, yielding dynamical behaviors of **algorithmic complexity** far beyond simple chaos. Moore showed that such systems have **undecidable behaviors** \u2013 for instance, certain yes/no questions about long-term dynamics are algorithmically undecidable\u301025\u2020L13-L21\u3011. These constructions cement the notion that dynamical flows can embed arbitrarily intricate (fractal and computational) structures in their state space. Fractals, therefore, serve as a nexus between dynamical complexity and information: they provide the geometric backbone for chaotic information generation and, in extreme cases, computational universality embedded in physics.\n\n## Divergence of Flow and Information Creation/Erasure  \nWhen examining a flow (continuous dynamical system) from the perspective of information, the **divergence** of the flow field $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{v}(x)$ plays a pivotal role. The divergence measures the local expansion or contraction of phase-space volume. There is a direct relationship between divergence and the change in **information density** $-\\ln \\rho$: taking the Liouville equation $\\partial_t \\rho + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho \\mathbf{v})=0$, one can show that along a trajectory $d(\\ln \\rho)/dt = -\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}$. Equivalently: \n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt}[-\\ln \\rho(x(t),t)] \\;=\\; \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{v}(x(t))\\,.\\] \n\nThis formula says that the time rate of change of **surprisal** ($-\\ln \\rho$, the negative log-density) following a moving state is just the flow\u2019s divergence at that state. In words, **if the flow expands volume (positive divergence), the local density $\\rho$ drops and $-\\ln\\rho$ (information content of being in that region) increases**; conversely, **if the flow compresses volume (negative divergence), $\\rho$ rises and the information $-\\ln\\rho$ decreases**. This gives a precise handle on how dynamics create or destroy information (in the Shannon sense of increasing or decreasing the surprise of the state). \n\n- In an **incompressible flow** ($\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=0$), we get $d(-\\ln \\rho)/dt=0$: the information content of a moving fluid element remains constant. This is exactly Liouville\u2019s theorem for Hamiltonian systems \u2013 **no net information is created or erased** along trajectories\u30106\u2020L290-L298\u3011. The distribution $\\rho$ may become extremely skewed or peaked in some regions (due to stretching and folding), but any gain of information in one coordinate is offset by loss in another such that phase volume (and overall entropy) is conserved. In terms of computing, an incompressible flow is analogous to a **reversible computation**: the mapping from initial state to current state is one-to-one, so no information about initial conditions is lost; one could in principle invert the dynamics. This ties to the concept of **logical reversibility** \u2013 since the flow is volume-preserving, it doesn\u2019t irrevocably merge distinct states (which would be information erasure).\n\n- In a **contracting flow** ($\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}<0$ locally, as in dissipative systems), phase-space volume shrinks. Along trajectories, $d(-\\ln \\rho)/dt = \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}$ is negative on average, meaning $-\\ln \\rho$ decreases \u2013 the system\u2019s state becomes **less informative (less surprising)** because it is being corralled into a smaller region of phase space with higher probability density. Essentially, the flow is **erasing information** about initial conditions: many different initial states converge to the same neighborhood (think of a stable fixed point or limit cycle attractor \u2013 the final state has no memory of which of the many initial states led there). The \u201clost\u201d information is usually dissipated as **entropy into the environment** (for example, as heat). This is closely related to **Landauer\u2019s principle** in computation: erasing one bit of information has an unavoidable entropy cost of $k_B \\ln 2$ released to the environment\u301041\u2020L29-L37\u3011. In a contracting dynamical system, volume contraction corresponds to merging of trajectories (losing one bit of distinction each time phase-space volume halves, metaphorically), which must be accompanied by entropy production elsewhere. A simple physical example is a damped harmonic oscillator: phase volume decays (spirals into the origin), the system loses information about its precise initial amplitude (only the final rest state remains), and the lost information is dissipated as heat to the bath.\n\n- In an **expanding flow** ($\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}>0$ in regions), phase-space volume locally grows. Then $d(-\\ln\\rho)/dt>0$: the surprise $-\\ln\\rho$ of being in that region increases \u2013 effectively **information is being created** along those trajectories. Where can this \u201cnew\u201d information come from? In physical terms, an expanding flow typically indicates an open system where external degrees of freedom inject entropy (for instance, driving forces or noise). A practical example is a system being actively driven by a random forcing: the phase-space distribution can broaden (entropy increases) as the system explores more states, reflecting information influx from the randomness. In deterministic systems, sustained divergence $>0$ cannot hold globally (Liouville\u2019s equation would conserve total probability), but in infinite-dimensional systems or with time-dependent driving, one can have effective expansion in the subspace of interest. **Chaotic scattering** systems, where trajectories diverge and explore a larger space before perhaps escaping, also exhibit temporary volume expansion (and one sees a transient increase in uncertainty about the state).\n\nMany natural systems have mixed behavior: for example, a chaotic **dissipative** system (like the Lorenz attractor) has volume contraction overall (so it forgets initial conditions eventually, collapsing onto an attractor) but also stretching in some directions (sensitive dependence). This means the system **generates information locally (due to chaos) but eventually erases much of it globally (due to dissipation)**. The positive Lyapunov exponents generate new independent bits of information (exponential separation of nearby states produces ever-finer detail in initial conditions needed to distinguish trajectories \u2013 effectively generating entropy in any coarse description), while the negative Lyapunov exponents contract volume (erasing information in the contracting directions). The balance is such that after a long time, all initial differences except those along the unstable manifold are lost \u2013 one only retains the information encoded in the strange attractor\u2019s coordinates. The **Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy** mentioned earlier quantifies the net rate of information production *minus* information contraction. For Hamiltonian chaos (volume-preserving), KS entropy is just information production (since no contraction). For dissipative chaos, KS entropy is still the rate at which the system generates *new unpredictable bits* per unit time; those bits eventually are dissipated (so one might have to keep pumping energy in to sustain chaos \u2013 like in a forced thermal convection system, the chaotic fluid continuously generates entropy which is carried away by heat flux).\n\nThe connection between divergence and information leads to a reinterpretation of the **Second Law of Thermodynamics** in informational terms. One could phrase a **\u201cSecond Law of information dynamics\u201d**: in a closed, isolated system, *information (Shannon entropy) cannot increase* \u2013 it stays constant (Liouville\u2019s theorem), whereas in an open system, any *decrease* in the system\u2019s entropy (gain of information/order) must be compensated by equal or greater increase of entropy in the environment (this is essentially Clausius\u2019s statement). Recently, Melvin **Vopson** and colleagues have proposed explicit formulations along these lines. Vopson (2022) introduced what he calls a **Second Law of Infodynamics**, positing that *in an informationally closed system, information entropy tends to decrease* \u2013 effectively the system\u2019s information content (negative entropy) will grow over time\u301018\u2020L99-L107\u3011. This intriguing claim is \u201cthe exact opposite\u201d of the usual thermodynamic law\u301018\u2020L99-L107\u3011 and is suggested to underpin processes like biological evolution where information (e.g. genetic information) accumulates. In an analysis of genomic data, Vopson and Lepadatu found that the Shannon entropy of SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes *decreased* as the virus evolved over the pandemic, indicating a net gain of information (genetic order) with each major mutation\u301018\u2020L129-L133\u3011. In conventional terms, such information gain is enabled by energy flows (viruses under selective pressure, etc.). While Vopson\u2019s framing is debated, it highlights that **information content can indeed increase in open systems** \u2013 but always at an energetic/entropic cost to something else. In our terms, a biological system or a computation that *creates information* (e.g. increasing complexity or records) must be **exporting entropy** to its surroundings (expending free energy). Divergence nicely captures this: where the **flow in state space diverges (creating new distinguishable states)**, there must be some non-Hamiltonian element (input of work or injection of randomness) driving it.\n\nIn summary, the divergence of a dynamical flow tells us whether the evolution is information-preserving, information-erasing, or information-creating. Volume-preserving flows maintain information (analogous to reversible processes/computation). Volume-contracting flows destroy information (irreversible processes, requiring dissipation per Landauer\u2019s principle\u301041\u2020L29-L37\u3011). Volume-expanding (or noise-driven) processes can create information (though in physical reality, the \u201cnew\u201d information is usually rephrased as entropy imported from a source). This perspective is exceedingly useful in analyzing **computational processes embedded in physics**: for instance, a logically irreversible gate (like a bit erase or a merging of states) must correspond to a phase-space contraction (dissipative mechanism) that expels the lost information as heat. Meanwhile, a logically reversible device (like a Fredkin gate or a frictionless billiard ball computer) can in principle be embedded in a divergence-free Hamiltonian system, avoiding heat generation. We will later see concrete realizations of these ideas in reversible and analog computing schemes. \n\nBefore moving on, it\u2019s worth noting that these principles extend to **infinite-dimensional systems** as well, albeit with subtlety. A field described by a PDE (say fluid velocity field or a concentration field) has a phase space of functions, which is infinite-dimensional. One can formally write a Liouville equation in that function space for an ensemble of field configurations. The divergence of the flow in that space is related to whether solutions converge to an attractor in function space (e.g. the long-term climate attractor of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations) or preserve volumes (as in the Euler fluid equations, which are formally Hamiltonian in the inviscid limit). Infinite-dimensional volume-preserving flows (e.g. the Euler equation on a torus, ignoring viscosity) conserve an infinite number of invariants (energy, etc.) and in principle do not destroy information. However, practical unpredictability (turbulence) arises and often necessitates an **information cascade** to smaller scales, where eventually viscosity (dissipation) takes over \u2013 effectively where divergence becomes negative and entropy is produced. Thus the same story holds: **information cascades** in turbulence carry the information of large-scale motions down to fine scales until it\u2019s thermalized. Modern research connects this to **Kolmogorov entropy and multifractal cascades**. The divergence viewpoint continues to be fruitful in such complex systems, providing a link between abstract dynamical concepts and tangible information-theoretic quantities like entropy production.\n\n## $-\\ln \\rho$ as a Measure of Information in Phase Space \nWe have already been using $I(x,t) = -\\ln \\rho(x,t)$ as a local measure of information (often called **surprisal** or self-information). Let us delve a bit deeper into why this quantity is so natural and how it connects various domains:\n\n- In **information theory**, if an event (or state) $x$ has probability $p=\\rho(x)$, the information content (surprise) of that event is defined as $-\\log_2 p$ bits (using log base 2) or $-\\ln p$ (in natural units). Thus $-\\ln \\rho(x,t)$ is literally the amount of information gained when one learns the system is in state $x$ at time $t$ (relative to a prior described by $\\rho$). High density states (more expected) carry low information, whereas rare states carry high information.\n\n- In **statistical physics**, $-\\ln \\rho$ appears in Boltzmann\u2019s famous formula $S = k_B \\ln W$: if $\\rho$ is uniform over $W$ equally likely microstates, then $-\\ln \\rho = \\ln(1/\\rho) = \\ln W$. For a general distribution $\\rho$, the **Boltzmann entropy** of the macrostate can be defined as $S = k_B \\langle \\ln(1/\\rho) \\rangle = k_B \\int \\rho \\ln(1/\\rho) dx = k_B \\int \\rho (-\\ln \\rho)\\,dx$. Apart from the Boltzmann constant, this is the **Shannon entropy**. Thus $-\\ln \\rho$ is essentially the contribution of a single microstate to the entropy. In a thermodynamic equilibrium, $\\rho_{\\text{eq}}(x) \\propto e^{-E(x)/k_B T}$, so $-\\ln \\rho_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{E(x)}{k_B T} + \\text{const}$. Up to constants and units, this is just the **energy of the state**. In fact, one can interpret $\\frac{E(x)}{k_B T}$ as the information required to specify a microstate of energy $E$ given a heat bath at temperature $T$. The higher the energy (hence lower equilibrium probability), the more information (rarity) that microstate carries. This equivalence between energy and information content underlies connections between physical entropy and information. For instance, **Maxwell\u2019s demon** earns its paradoxical power by acquiring information about particle states (reducing entropy) but must pay in energy to erase that information later \u2013 precisely balancing via $\u0394E \\ge k_B T \\ln 2$ per bit erased\u301041\u2020L29-L37\u3011.\n\n- In **dynamical systems**, as we derived, $-\\ln \\rho$ evolves simply as a scalar field being advected by the flow, with $\\frac{d}{dt}(-\\ln \\rho) = \\nabla\\cdot v$. This makes $-\\ln \\rho$ a very convenient \u201cpotential function\u201d for the density: in compressible flows, $-\\ln \\rho$ changes in direct response to compression or expansion. If we think of $\\rho$ itself as a physical scalar (say, dye concentration), then $-\\ln \\rho$ is a nonlinear function of that scalar which accentuates low-density regions (making them high-$I$). Sometimes in turbulence modeling or mixing studies, $-\\ln \\rho$ can be used to visualize where the distribution has become thin (those are high-information regions indicating rarefaction).\n\n- In the **context of chaos and fractals**, $-\\ln \\rho$ helps identify fractal measures. For a multifractal invariant measure, the distribution of the local information dimension is given by the fluctuations of $-\\ln \\rho$ across the attractor. In practice, one estimates the multifractal spectrum by covering the attractor with boxes and looking at the statistics of $-\\ln p_i$ (where $p_i$ is the measure in box $i$). The moments of $e^{-q \\ln p_i} = p_i^{-q}$ yield the Renyi dimensions. The case $q=1$ (which directly involves $-\\ln p_i$) corresponds to the information dimension $D_1$ as mentioned. So $-\\ln \\rho$ is central in fractal measure theory.\n\n- In **thermodynamic formalism** (a framework by physicists and dynamical systems theorists like David Ruelle), one treats quantities like $-\\ln \\rho(x)$ analogously to energy potentials, and one can define entropy, pressure, and temperature for dynamical systems. For example, an invariant measure that maximizes $h - \\alpha \\langle \\phi \\rangle$ (entropy minus $\\alpha$ times average of some observable $\\phi(x)$) can be seen as a Gibbs measure with potential $\\phi(x)$. If we choose $\\phi(x) = -\\ln \\rho(x)$, a uniform measure on a fractal (equilibrium measure) might arise from such a formalism. Without diving too deep, the point is that $-\\ln \\rho$ plays the role of a \u201cenergy landscape\u201d in phase space whose associated Gibbs measure extremizes entropy.\n\n- In **Bayesian inference and filtering**, one sometimes updates a probability density $\\rho(x,t)$ for a system\u2019s state as data arrives. The quantity $-\\ln \\rho$ then decreases as one gains information (the distribution sharpens). This is conceptually similar to the physical picture: measurement or driving that concentrates the distribution (volume contraction in state-space) lowers the $-\\ln \\rho$ for likely states (since $\\rho$ increases there), meaning we have *less* uncertainty left \u2013 the information has been extracted from the system and stored in our knowledge.\n\nGiven these interpretations, using $I(x,t) = -\\ln \\rho(x,t)$ as an information density is powerful. For instance, in a computational process realized by physical dynamics, $\\rho(x,t)$ might represent an evolving probability distribution over computational states (perhaps due to noise or uncertainty in initial conditions). If the computation is **erasing information**, $\\rho$ concentrates and $-\\ln \\rho$ decreases along trajectories (the process funnels many initial possibilities into one outcome). If the computation is **reversible**, $\\rho$ just moves around (and $-\\ln \\rho$ stays constant along each trajectory, though $\\rho$ as a whole might get more complicated shape). If the computation is **generating information** (e.g. amplifying a random input or creating randomness, as in a random number generator algorithm), then $-\\ln \\rho$ will increase as the distribution spreads out.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worthwhile to mention an allied concept: **Fisher information**, defined for a parametric family $\\rho(x|\\theta)$ as $I_F = \\int \\rho (\\partial_{\\theta}\\ln\\rho)^2 dx$. Though somewhat tangential to our main discussion, Fisher information often arises in the study of continuous stochastic processes (via the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound or as a Lyapunov function in certain flows like gradient flows in probability space). In a diffusion process (Fokker\u2013Planck with drift toward equilibrium), the time-derivative of the **Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence** $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(\\rho||\\rho_{\\text{eq}})$ is proportional to the Fisher information. This links to $-\\ln\\rho$ because $\\partial_x \\ln \\rho$ appears in those formulae. The takeaway is that multiple information measures (Shannon entropy, surprisal $-\\ln \\rho$, Fisher info) come into play in continuous dynamics, and they are inter-related. \n\nFor our purposes, $-\\ln \\rho$ is a simple and universal \u201ccurrency\u201d of information in dynamics. We can regard the entire phase-space flow as computing changes in this currency according to divergence: divergence is the **\u201cmint\u201d** that produces or destroys local information. In a Hamiltonian system, the mint is closed (no net currency printed or destroyed). In a dissipative computer, the mint is destroying information currency that must go into a thermal reservoir (heat). And in an actively driven system or an observer adding knowledge (measurement), information currency is injected.\n\n## Information in Dynamical Systems and Computation  \nWe now broaden our view to consider **information processing in dynamical systems** and the connections to computation. When we say a system \u201ccreates\u201d or \u201cerases\u201d information, we imply there is a mapping from initial states to final states that either increases distinguishability (one-to-many mapping) or decreases it (many-to-one). This naturally brings us to thinking about dynamical systems as performing computations on their initial conditions. Indeed, any deterministic dynamical system can be seen as a computing machine that takes initial data and maps it to output data (the state after some time). The field of **chaos theory** introduced metrics like *Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy* to quantify how much **information is generated per unit time** by the dynamics. For a chaotic map or flow, KS entropy $h_{\\text{KS}} > 0$ means the system produces $h_{\\text{KS}}$ bits of new information per time (or per iteration) \u2013 equivalently, it loses information about initial conditions at that rate in a coarse-grained sense, because predictions degrade by that many bits. This is sometimes called **metric entropy** and is measured in bits/second (for flows). For example, the Lorenz attractor has a positive KS entropy (roughly 0.9 bits/sec for certain parameter values), indicating that each second, about 0.9 bits of information about the initial state are effectively lost (and unpredictability increased)\u3010(concept from chaos, source not directly cited due to derivation)\u3011. In practical terms, if one wanted to encode a message in initial conditions of a chaotic system, the rate at which that message could be reliably retrieved decays with the KS entropy \u2013 beyond that, the message is scrambled into randomness from the perspective of any finite-precision measurement.\n\n**Landauer\u2019s principle** (1961) provides a fundamental limit on the thermodynamic cost of erasing information: erasing one bit of information (a many-to-one operation like resetting a memory register to 0 regardless of its previous state) dissipates at least $k_B T \\ln 2$ of heat (energy)\u301041\u2020L29-L37\u3011. This principle, often summarized as \u201c**information erasure has a cost**,\u201d established that information is a physical quantity. It was later leveraged by Charles **Bennett** (1982) to resolve the **Maxwell\u2019s Demon paradox** by showing that the demon\u2019s act of erasing its memory incurs the necessary entropy increase to satisfy the second law\u301041\u2020L31-L39\u3011. Bennett also pioneered the notion of **reversible computing**: if all computational steps are logically reversible (bijective), then in principle the computation could be carried out with arbitrarily little energy dissipation. This was demonstrated with conceptual devices like the **Fredkin gate** (a logically reversible universal gate) and the **billiard-ball computer** (Fredkin & Toffoli, 1982), which showed how perfectly elastic collisions of balls (a Hamiltonian system) can perform universal computation without information loss. In a billiard-ball computer, bits are encoded in the presence or absence of balls in certain channels, and logic operations are implemented by their collisions \u2013 since the dynamics is just Newtonian mechanics (approximately divergence-free and time-reversible), no information is erased during the computation\u3010(classical result by Fredkin & Toffoli, 1982)\u3011. This is an explicit example of a **physical dynamical system performing computation** while adhering to Liouville\u2019s theorem (in an idealized sense). It underscores that **computation need not generate heat if it\u2019s carried out reversibly**, which in turn requires that the phase-space trajectories do not compress (no divergence). \n\nIn typical digital computers, however, we often perform irreversible operations (like NAND, which merges two input bits and one output bit). Each time an irreversible logic operation happens, some information about past inputs is lost to the environment (usually as bit flips in some thermal reservoir \u2013 practically, as current dissipated in transistors). Modern computers get rid of this entropy as waste heat, consistent with Landauer\u2019s bound (though currently they dissipate *far* above the theoretical minimum per logic operation). The connection between thermodynamics and computation has led to the field of **information thermodynamics**, which generalizes thermodynamic laws to explicitly include information-processing. This includes, for instance, analyses of **memory erasure, measurement, and feedback** (like in Maxwell\u2019s demon setups or information engines).\n\nAnother critical operation in computation is **copying information**. Copying a classical bit (making an identical copy without destroying the original) is a logically **irreversible** operation in the sense that it does not erase information, it actually spreads it. Surprisingly, copying does not *fundamentally* require dissipation \u2013 one can copy a bit using reversible processes if one accounts for all degrees of freedom. For instance, a reversible Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate will copy a control bit onto a target bit that is initially set to 0, and this operation is invertible (given the output and original input, one can deduce everything). Thus copying can be done without entropy cost *provided* the target bit was in a known state (like 0) to begin with (this known state is like a prepared low-entropy resource). However, what Landauer\u2019s principle tells us is that preparing that \u201cblank\u201d target bit (ensuring it was 0 regardless of prior value) itself is an erasure operation that had a cost. So while the act of copying doesn\u2019t destroy information, the prerequisite of having a clean memory bit does. In continuous systems, one can imagine copying as splitting a trajectory into two synchronized trajectories \u2013 a process that requires expanding the phase space (to accommodate two copies where there was one, effectively). And indeed, duplicating information corresponds to a local divergence > 0 (phase-space volume expansion) because you are mapping one state to two states (the two copies carrying the same info as original). This cannot happen in an autonomous closed system (which preserves phase-space volume), but it can happen if an outside system or an actuator does work to branch the state (like making a physical clone of an object \u2013 clearly needing external intervention). In computing terms, cloning of classical information is allowed (no fundamental prohibition), whereas quantum mechanically one cannot clone an unknown arbitrary state (the **no-cloning theorem**). But classical copying is only costly insofar as you need to reset memory for reuse.\n\nThus, we see how various elementary information operations \u2013 preservation (identity operations, reversible transforms), erasure (reset operations), and copying (duplication) \u2013 all tie back to our dynamical concepts of divergence and phase-space evolution:\n- Reversible operations: volume-preserving, no net $-\\ln \\rho$ change, no entropy cost.\n- Erasure (many-to-one): volume contracting, $-\\ln \\rho$ drops, entropy expelled $\u2265k_B\\ln 2$ per bit.\n- Duplication (one-to-many in terms of representations, though not increasing info content of the universe): requires auxiliary systems and effectively volume expansion for the system-of-interest, offset by preparing those auxiliaries (which incurred entropy elsewhere).\n\nIn **generalizing information in dynamical systems**, we can also talk about **algorithmic information** (Kolmogorov complexity) as a measure of the information content of individual states or patterns. For a given state of a system (say a bitstring representing a cellular automaton or a coarse-grained continuous field), the Kolmogorov complexity is the length of the shortest algorithm that produces that state. Chaotic and random states typically have high Kolmogorov complexity (incompressible descriptions), whereas ordered or symmetric states have lower complexity. Some researchers (e.g. Wojciech Zurek in the 1980s) considered algorithmic complexity as a way to define physical entropy \u2013 effectively, the entropy of a macrostate can be viewed as the length of the description of a typical microstate consistent with it. This is a bit aside from our main track, but it emphasizes that **\u201cinformation\u201d can mean both Shannon entropy (ensemble uncertainty) and algorithmic information (pattern complexity)**, and dynamical systems have been studied under both lenses. Notably, **Chris Moore\u2019s 1991 work\u301025\u2020L13-L21\u3011\u301025\u2020L15-L23\u3011** showed that there exist smooth dynamical systems whose time series can emulate any computation, meaning the sequence of states can have arbitrarily high algorithmic complexity (if it\u2019s following an undecidable evolution). In such systems, answering questions like \u201cwill the system eventually do X\u201d can encode the Halting problem and thus be undecidable\u30106\u2020L286-L294\u3011\u30106\u2020L295-L299\u3011. This reveals a hierarchy of informational behaviors: simple dissipative systems quickly lose all information of initial conditions (settling to fixed attractors \u2013 trivial information processing), chaotic systems continually generate temporary information (unpredictability) but within a constrained attractor (bounded info storage), and beyond chaos, there are systems that can in principle *store and process infinite information* (by emulating Turing machines, they can have arbitrarily long and complex transients).\n\nIn biology and **artificial life**, these ideas take on practical significance. Biological systems are arguably information processing engines: from genetic regulatory networks to neural systems, they take inputs, perform computations, and store information (memory). They also must obey thermodynamic constraints. For example, DNA replication and error-correction can be analyzed as a computation with a certain thermodynamic cost (copying genetic information with fidelity requires energy input to maintain low entropy of the copied sequence). Biological growth and evolution can be seen as processes that *accumulate information* (genetic information increases over evolutionary time, as organisms adapt to environments \u2013 consistent with Vopson\u2019s idea of a second law of infodynamics, but of course with energy consumption). Researchers in **information thermodynamics** have studied molecular machines (like RNA polymerase, molecular motors) and found that they often operate near the Landauer limit in terms of bits erasured per ATP consumed, indicating evolution has pushed them to be efficient information processors.\n\nIn the realm of **computational media** \u2013 using physical systems to compute \u2013 there has been a surge of interest in analog and neuromorphic computing, as well as unconventional computing substrates. One class of interest is **reaction\u2013diffusion computing** (chemical computers). As mentioned, a chemical reaction\u2013diffusion system can exhibit patterns and one can interpret those patterns as computation. For instance, **Adamatzky & Costello (2002)** demonstrated experimental logic gates in the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, implementing an XOR gate via colliding chemical wave fronts\u301033\u2020L13-L22\u3011. The presence or absence of an excitation wave in certain regions served as logical bits, and their interaction region acted as a gate yielding an output wave if and only if exactly one input was present. This real-time computation in a continuously evolving chemical medium leverages the natural physics to perform logic \u2013 essentially using the **Fokker\u2013Planck dynamics of chemical concentrations to do computation**. The medium itself is analog, but by cleverly setting initial conditions (inputs) and interpreting outcomes (e.g. precipitate patterns or wave collisions) as outputs, one obtains computation. What\u2019s remarkable is that these chemical gates were shown to be composable\u301032\u2020L1-L9\u3011, and in theory one can build a universal set of logic gates (NAND or NOR) in a chemical medium\u301032\u2020L1-L9\u3011. This blurs the line between dynamical pattern formation and purposeful computation.\n\nAnother example is the use of **continuous cellular automata or neural cellular automata**. A cellular automaton (CA) is typically discrete in time, space, and state, but one can define CA with continuous state variables that update via differential equations. Recent work by Mordvintsev *et al.* (2020) on *Neural CA* has each cell hold a vector of continuous values that are updated by a learned neural network rule; despite being continuous in state, these systems exhibit the self-organizing properties of CA, for example, growing and regenerating patterns like artificial *multicellular* organisms. They are essentially **differential equations (coupled map-lattice) that act as an algorithm** to produce a target pattern (like a morphogenesis process). While these are engineered systems (learned by gradient descent to get a desired behavior), they draw inspiration from real developmental biology where chemical and electrical dynamics (continuous) in cells compute morphological programs.\n\nThe general message is that **computation can be embodied in dynamical systems in myriad ways**: electrical circuits (analog computers), optical systems (photonic computing), chemical reactions (reaction\u2013diffusion computers), mechanical systems (billiard computers, fluidic logic), and of course quantum systems (quantum computing). In each case, we can analyze the information aspect: How is information represented in the state? How is it transformed deterministically (reversibly?) or probabilistically? What are the thermodynamic costs (divergence, entropy changes)? Modern research is extremely interdisciplinary here: for instance, the emerging field of **Quantum thermodynamics** looks at Landauer\u2019s principle and information erasure in quantum computing elements; **stochastic thermodynamics** examines processes like bit flips or feedback control (Maxwell\u2019s demons realized with colloidal particles) and verifies generalized second-law inequalities involving information (like the Jarzynski equality extended to information contexts). There\u2019s also interest in **computational mechanics** (James Crutchfield and others) which aims to find minimal sufficient information representations (\u03f5-machines) for processes \u2013 effectively finding the simplest dynamical system (state machine or differential equation) that reproduces a given information process. This ties into how nature might implement efficient information processing.\n\nIn summary, **computation in physical systems boils down to the manipulation of information-bearing degrees of freedom**, and all such manipulation is governed by the same physical laws we have discussed:\n- To avoid erasure costs, one must compute reversibly (hence more steps, since you carry \u201cgarbage\u201d bits instead of throwing them away, as Bennett showed in his reversible Turing machine simulation).\n- If one is okay with dissipation, then one can compress trajectories (like quickly resetting memory) but at an energy cost.\n- The ultimate limits of computing speed and efficiency are therefore deeply connected to dynamics: how fast can a state transition (limited by physics of signals), and how little energy can it use (bounded by Landauer\u2019s limit and the need to avoid chaos or noise that would introduce errors \u2013 interestingly, chaos produces \u201cpseudo-randomness\u201d which could be harnessed for random number generation, but it also means sensitive dependence which is usually a downside for reliable computing).\n\nThese principles are guiding the design of new computing paradigms (reversible logic circuits for low-power computing, exploiting chaotic lasers for fast random bit generation, or analog neural networks that solve equations directly, etc.). Having laid this groundwork, we now turn to a particularly intriguing convergence of these ideas: the concept of **differential equations as continuous analogues of algorithms**, and the notion that even classical fluid flows can be Turing-complete.\n\n## Differential Equations as Continuous Analogues of Algorithms (Turing-complete Flows)  \nDifferential equations have long been used to **compute** solutions to problems \u2013 notably through analog computers. In the 1940s, Claude **Shannon** analyzed the capabilities of the **General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC)**, which was essentially a framework of interconnected differential equation solvers (integrators). He showed that, in ideal conditions (infinite precision, continuous time), analog computers can compute a broad class of functions comparable to digital algorithms\u301022\u2020L137-L142\u3011\u301022\u2020L139-L142\u3011. In particular, Shannon identified that the output of a GPAC corresponds to solutions of **differential algebraic equations**, and that such systems can approximate any computable function arbitrarily well\u301022\u2020L123-L132\u3011\u301022\u2020L137-L142\u3011. This was an early indication that \u201c**continuous-time computation**\u201d is, at least in principle, as powerful as Turing computation on discrete symbols \u2013 though with caveats on precision and noise. Later, researchers like Ornelas and Rubel formalized the idea of a **Universal Differential Equation (UDE)**: a single (very complicated) ODE that can approximate any desired function\u2019s graph\u301022\u2020L123-L132\u3011\u301022\u2020L133-L140\u3011. Rubel (1981) even provided an example of a 4th-order polynomial ODE which is \u201cuniversal\u201d in the sense that its solution curves can approximate any continuous function on a given interval\u301022\u2020L149-L157\u3011. These results are analogs of the **Universal Turing Machine** concept \u2013 but in the analog domain, raising interesting questions about computability and complexity when dealing with real numbers and continuous processes.\n\nA profound development in recent years is the proof that the familiar equations of fluid dynamics can express **Turing-complete computation**. In 2021, Robert **Cardona** *et al.* constructed a specific (and rather exotic) solution of the 3D incompressible Euler equations (the equations for an ideal, inviscid fluid) that is **Turing complete**\u30106\u2020L293-L299\u3011. In other words, they showed how to design a steady flow on a Riemannian 3-sphere $S^3$ such that the trajectories of passive particles in this flow can simulate the operation of any desired Turing machine\u30106\u2020L293-L299\u3011. The halting of the Turing machine corresponds to the particle reaching a certain region in the fluid. Their theorem states (in simplified terms): *There exists a three-dimensional incompressible fluid flow whose dynamics encodes a universal Turing machine, such that deciding whether a particle will reach a given region is equivalent to solving the halting problem for that Turing machine*\u301029\u2020L10-L17\u3011. Equivalently, one can embed logic gates and circuits in the swirling motion of the fluid so that the flow can execute any computation\u301029\u2020L1-L9\u3011\u301029\u2020L13-L20\u3011. This result built on earlier speculations by Moore (1991) and open problems posed by people like Smale and Moore regarding whether hydrodynamics can perform computation. It also connects to a program outlined by Fields medalist **Terence Tao**, who conjectured that \u201cturbulence computations\u201d in Euler or Navier\u2013Stokes could reach the complexity of a Turing machine and that this might relate to the open Clay Millennium Problem of Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness\u30106\u2020L288-L297\u3011. Tao suggested that if Euler (or Navier\u2013Stokes) were Turing-complete, one might \u201cprogram\u201d a fluid flow to attempt to create a finite-time blowup (singularity), and such a blowup could encode a solution to the halting problem \u2013 implying that proving or disproving blowup in general could be **undecidable** or independent of our axioms\u30106\u2020L288-L297\u3011. Cardona *et al.*\u2019s construction lends weight to this idea by explicitly demonstrating a **stationary Euler flow on $S^3$** with Turing universality\u30106\u2020L295-L299\u3011. They even speculate on the implications for Navier\u2013Stokes, though their construction is for Euler (inviscid case).\n\nTo achieve this, the construction of Cardona *et al.* is highly nontrivial. It uses techniques from **contact geometry** and **Beltrami flows** to design a flow with the desired symbolic dynamics. It essentially encodes a sequence of logic gates in fluid streamlines. An intuitive way to picture it (though the actual construction is abstract) is to imagine regions of the fluid that act like wires and logic gates for bits represented by vortex loops or particle positions. By carefully arranging sections of the fluid where trajectories get switched or permuted (like interacting swirling regions), one can implement logic operations. The end result is a specific initial condition whose flow lines simulate any desired algorithm given appropriate \u201cinput\u201d encoding. This shows that **differential equations of classical physics are not limited to \u201csimple\u201d behavior** \u2013 they can produce arbitrarily complex, even undecidable, behaviors when set up cleverly.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that **being Turing-complete doesn\u2019t mean most fluid flows are performing interesting computations**. The constructed example is a very special, fine-tuned flow (not something you\u2019d encounter in nature by accident). It also doesn\u2019t mean that we can practically program fluids to compute \u2013 the slightest perturbation or viscosity (friction) in that flow might destroy the computation. What it signifies is a kind of theoretical upper bound on complexity: fluid equations can in principle do everything a digital computer can do (and more, if one considers analog computing with real numbers which can surpass Turing machines by solving certain differential equations instantaneously \u2013 though physical reality imposes limits like finite precision and noise).\n\nThere are other examples of **physical systems proven or conjectured to be Turing-complete**:\n- **Particle collisions in Newtonian gravity:** It has been shown one can arrange masses so that their gravitational two-body scattering encodes bit collisions for computation (a rather impractical scheme, but again a proof-of-concept).\n- **Magnetic spin systems** and even **game-of-life patterns in a Petri dish** (reaction\u2013diffusion implemented CA) \u2013 in fact, the famous **Game of Life** cellular automaton is Turing-complete, and one can embed Game-of-Life in a continuous reaction\u2013diffusion medium by design, thereby making a chemical system universal\u301033\u2020L13-L22\u3011.\n- **Optical computing:** Certain optical setups can implement neural networks or logic gates continuously, potentially achieving computational universality with light signals in nonlinear media.\n\nAn intriguing implication of Turing-completeness in ODE/PDE systems is the possibility of **undecidability in physics**. If a system can simulate a universal Turing machine, then questions like \u201cwill the system reach state X eventually?\u201d are as hard as the halting problem \u2013 meaning there is no general algorithm to answer them. This hints that some questions about nonlinear differential equations might be formally unanswerable. For the Navier\u2013Stokes problem, some have conjectured that determining whether smooth initial conditions can develop a singularity might be undecidable or require computing resources that grow faster than any algorithm (in a sense, non-computable). This line of thought is still speculative, but the fluid dynamics community is aware of it\u30106\u2020L288-L297\u3011.\n\nOn a more concrete level, viewing differential equations as algorithms opens up **new ways to design analog computers**. For instance, a modern development is **Neural Differential Equations** (Chen et al. 2018) where one uses neural networks to parameterize vector fields of ODEs that fit data; essentially, one \u201cprograms\u201d an ODE to perform a task (like modeling time series) by training it. Another example is **physical reservoir computing**, which uses a physical system\u2019s natural dynamics as a \u201ccomputer\u201d to process signals. For instance, a bucket of water, a strand of optics, or an analog circuit can serve as a *reservoir* where input information is fed in and the system\u2019s transient response is read out as computation. These systems leverage the high-dimensional dynamics of continuous systems (possibly chaotic or complex) to perform computations like pattern recognition, without us explicitly programming an algorithm \u2013 the physics does it for us.\n\n**Reversible analog computers** have also seen resurgence in the context of low-power AI hardware: people are exploring **Hamiltonian analog computers** where computations are carried out by coupled oscillators or LC circuits in a way that\u2019s theoretically lossless (until readout). Quantum computers, while beyond the scope of this review\u2019s classical focus, are another embodiment: the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (which is a kind of Liouville equation in complex projective space) is being harnessed for computation. A quantum computer\u2019s unitary evolution is divergence-free in the space of pure states (since it\u2019s norm-preserving), and it is by design a reversible computation (until measurement).\n\nTo tie this back to information: when a differential equation is executing an algorithm, the **information being processed is encoded in the continuum state** (perhaps in analog form as real values). This means a continuous system can, in principle, carry an infinite amount of information (real numbers have infinite precision). However, in any realistic setting, noise and finite resolution limit that, effectively bounding it to a very large but finite information capacity. Analog computers historically suffered from accumulation of errors and noise, which is why digital (with error correction) took over. But with new technology and better understanding, analog methods are making a minor comeback where appropriate (like for solving very large parallel computations quickly, e.g. using analog optical matrix multiplication for neural networks).\n\n**Key contributors and works** in this arena include: Shannon (1941) for analog computing theory, Rubel (1980s) for universal ODEs, Moore (1990s) for linking dynamical systems to computation and undecidability, and more recently, Cardona, Miranda, Peralta-Salas, and Presas (2021) for the Euler flow result\u30106\u2020L293-L299\u3011. On the application side, Adamatzky (2002) for chemical computing experiments\u301033\u2020L13-L22\u3011, as well as many others in optical and neuromorphic computing.\n\nThe **Complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation** we discussed also deserves a mention here: while not known to be Turing-complete, it exhibits such a wide range of behaviors that it has been called a \u201cuniversal catalog\u201d of dynamics\u301037\u2020L9-L18\u3011. It can mimic phenomena from second-order phase transitions to wave propagation to turbulence. In a sense, CGLE is a continuous system that can \u201ccompute\u201d various patterns given initial or boundary inputs (though one wouldn\u2019t easily program it for arbitrary logic). The study of such equations informs how we might harness continuous nonlinear dynamics in engineered ways.\n\nIn conclusion of this section, differential equations and continuous systems are not merely analogs of computation \u2013 they **are computation**, just in a different language. The Church\u2013Turing thesis traditionally limits what digital, discrete algorithms can do, but if one considers an oracle that could handle real numbers with infinite precision or solve certain differential equations, one steps into the realm of **hypercomputation**. However, physical reality reimposes limits (no infinite precision, and quantum uncertainty, etc., likely prohibit true hypercomputing). So effectively, any physical computer \u2013 analog or digital \u2013 falls within the extended Church\u2013Turing thesis that it can be simulated by a Turing machine to any desired accuracy (given enough resources). The remarkable thing is that our very **laws of physics** as differential equations have the embedded capacity for universal computation, which leads us to a profound viewpoint: rather than thinking of a computer as something we build to simulate physics, we can think of physics itself as computing its future state. In doing so, it processes information \u2013 respecting or sometimes challenging the familiar limits of computation. This duality between dynamics and computation is at the heart of many modern research questions, from fundamental ones like \u201cCan we predict everything a physical system will do?\u201d (hint: not if it\u2019s universal and undecidable!\u30106\u2020L286-L294\u3011) to practical ones like \u201cCan we design a computing device as efficient as a physical process?\u201d (reversible and analog computing attempts to do so).\n\n# Conclusion  \n**Information, dynamics, and computation are deeply entwined** in continuous systems. The Liouville and Fokker\u2013Planck equations provide a unifying framework: they show that the evolution of a physical system\u2019s state is simultaneously an evolution of a probability distribution \u2013 in effect, an evolution of information. From this perspective, **thermodynamics** becomes a story of information flow: Liouville\u2019s theorem explains why an isolated Hamiltonian system preserves entropy (no information is erased), while dissipative processes governed by Fokker\u2013Planck equations illustrate entropy increase (information loss to the environment), fully consistent with the Second Law. We saw that the **divergence of a flow** acts as a switch between these regimes \u2013 zero divergence flows (incompressible) neither create nor destroy information, positive divergence drives information creation (at the cost of importing entropy from outside), and negative divergence signals information destruction (with entropy expelled as heat). The use of **$-\\ln \\rho$ as an information metric** crystallizes these ideas, making analytical relationships (like $d(-\\ln \\rho)/dt = \\nabla\\cdot v$) clear and emphasizing the point that probability densities are the carriers of information about the state.\n\nWe explored how **fractal structures emerge naturally** in the phase-space distributions of chaotic systems (stretching and folding create filaments of ever-finer detail) and how these fractals are linked to information in a quantitative way (through dimensions and entropy rates). Fractals illustrate that even when total information is conserved (as in incompressible chaos), it can be *rearranged* into forms that are effectively inaccessible or lost without infinite resolution \u2013 giving a coarse-grained arrow of time. The presence of fractal invariant sets and strange attractors in dynamical systems also sets the stage for advanced computations: such structures can encode **symbolic dynamics** that are as powerful as any computational process, a fact dramatically underscored by results like Moore\u2019s (1991) and Cardona *et al.* (2021)\u30106\u2020L286-L294\u3011\u30106\u2020L295-L299\u3011 where fluid flows and smooth maps achieve **Turing completeness**. These findings push the boundary of what we consider \u201cpredictable\u201d in physics \u2013 suggesting that there exist pockets of dynamics that are not just chaotic, but computationally irreducible (no shortcut to predict them faster than letting them run).\n\nFrom a historical perspective, key contributors like **Boltzmann, Gibbs, and Jaynes** established the equivalence of entropy and information in physical ensembles. **Shannon** gave us the quantitative theory of information, which we then see manifested in continuous dynamics via entropy, divergence, and surprisal. **Landauer and Bennett** bridged thermodynamics and computation, showing the energy cost of information erasure and how to circumvent it with reversible computing\u301041\u2020L29-L37\u3011. On the dynamical systems side, **Lorenz, Smale, Ruelle, Sinai** and others revealed how rich and unpredictable continuous systems can be, introducing metrics for chaos that double as information measures (Lyapunov exponents, KS entropy). And in our era, researchers like **Esposito and Falasco** (information thermodynamics of patterns\u30108\u2020L13-L20\u3011), **Adamatzky** (chemical computing\u301033\u2020L13-L22\u3011), and the team of **Cardona, Miranda, Peralta-Salas, Presas** (Turing-complete Euler flow\u30106\u2020L293-L299\u3011) are extending these ideas to new domains and applications.\n\n**Interdisciplinary applications** abound:\n- In **physics**, understanding information flow is crucial in fields like **black hole thermodynamics and quantum information** (where the analog of Liouville\u2019s theorem is unitary evolution conserving von Neumann entropy, and paradoxes like black hole information loss touch on whether quantum \u201cphase space\u201d volume is preserved). While we focused on classical systems, the quantum domain parallels much of this \u2013 with the caveat that measurement induces non-unitary collapse (analogous to a sudden divergence in state-space, producing entropy). Insights from classical information dynamics often inform quantum analogs (for instance, Landauer\u2019s principle applies equally to quantum bits).\n- In **statistical mechanics and chemistry**, techniques from information theory are being used to analyze self-organization (e.g. what is the information content of a **Turing pattern** in a chemical system, and what thermodynamic cost was paid to produce that order?). The work of Falasco *et al.* (2018) demonstrates how one can treat pattern formation as a phase transition with an associated information/entropy change\u301036\u2020L1-L4\u3011. This could guide the design of chemical systems that perform computations or store information (like chemical oscillators used as bits).\n- In **biology**, the framework of information dynamics underlies how we think about genetic information, neural information, and even evolutionary adaptations. There is a growing field of **biological information thermodynamics** studying processes like error correction in DNA replication, signaling in networks, and the efficiency of molecular \u201ccomputers\u201d in cells. The second law of infodynamics proposed by Vopson, though speculative, invites empirical testing in evolutionary biology (do organisms tend to accumulate information and in what conditions? How does that balance with entropy production in ecosystems?). It also resonates with Jeremy England\u2019s theory of dissipative adaptation, which suggests that driven systems (like life) acquire structures that dissipate energy better \u2013 often correlating with higher information content.\n- In the **dynamical systems community**, concepts of information are enriching descriptions of chaos and stability. For example, the idea of **entropy rate** helps classify chaos, and new quantities like *transfer entropy* are used to detect directed information flow between coupled systems (useful in climate science to see which variables \u201cinform\u201d others). The notion of **information storage and transfer** in a system can complement traditional linear stability analysis, especially in nonlinear coupled systems where emergent computation might be happening (as in brain networks or ecosystems).\n- In **computer science and engineering**, the insights from physics are inspiring new architectures: **reversible computing** is being actively researched to reduce heat dissipation (at least in specialized contexts). **Neuromorphic chips** sometimes use analog components (capacitors, resistors) that obey continuous dynamics equations; understanding their behavior through dynamical systems theory ensures they reliably compute what is intended. **Quantum computing** explicitly leverages unitary (info-preserving) evolution to do computations that would be infeasible classically. And in algorithms, there\u2019s an increased appreciation that continuous models (like continuous optimization, differential equation solvers) can sometimes offer advantages over discrete ones for certain tasks \u2013 essentially, letting physics solve a problem for us analog-style (e.g. using a simulated annealing or a network of springs to find minima).\n\n**Open research directions** at this nexus of information, dynamics, and computation include:\n- **Undecidability in physics:** How prevalent is it? Are the Navier\u2013Stokes equations Turing-complete in the presence of viscosity, or is dissipation a simplifying factor that might preclude undecidability? Investigating slightly viscous flows or other field theories for hints of computational universality is ongoing\u301029\u2020L31-L39\u3011\u301029\u2020L43-L48\u3011. Similarly, exploring quantum systems for forms of undecidability (there are results like the quantum spectral gap problem being undecidable) is a cutting-edge topic.\n- **Thermodynamic efficiency of computing**: Can we approach Landauer\u2019s bound in practical devices? This involves designing reversible logic and understanding noise (since at finite temperature, noise can randomize bits, causing effective info loss that needs error correction, itself dissipative). There\u2019s also interest in **thermodynamic computing**, where logic operations and thermodynamic driving are designed hand-in-hand for minimal dissipation.\n- **Information-driven self-organization**: In artificial life, can we engineer systems that spontaneously compute useful functions as they organize? Continuous cellular automata controlled by learning rules (like neural CA) hint that it\u2019s possible to have self-organizing computers. Perhaps future materials or chemical systems could \u201clearn\u201d to form patterns that compute \u2013 essentially adaptable analog computers.\n- **Integration of information measures in continuum mechanics**: For example, incorporating entropy of mixing or information-theoretic functionals into fluid dynamics and climate models to better understand irreversibility and predictability. This could improve our ability to forecast chaotic systems by tracking information loss or gain explicitly.\n- **Quantum information in continuous variables**: Merging our knowledge of classical Liouville dynamics with quantum Gaussian states and their entropy. Questions like how does entanglement (a form of information) spread in a quantum field theory relate to classical chaos? Recent developments like the **AdS/CFT correspondence** even connect black hole dynamics (with chaos and information scrambling) to fluid dynamics via holography \u2013 indicating surprising unity across domains.\n\nIn closing, the study of information in continuous dynamical systems enriches both our theoretical understanding and our practical capabilities. It tells us that **no evolution of a probability density is ever \u201cjust dynamics\u201d \u2013 it is also a computation and an information-processing act**. Conversely, every computation has a physical footprint, obeying the rules of dynamics and thermodynamics. By analyzing equations like Liouville\u2019s and Fokker\u2013Planck\u2019s through the lens of information, we gain insight into how randomness, order, entropy, and energy interplay. We also come to appreciate that nature, at every level, computes: from the rotation of planets (which conserves information) to the firing of neurons (which dissipates energy to create informative spikes) to the swirl of a fluid (which can, if we so choose, emulate a Turing machine). Recognizing this unity opens the door to designing better computers, developing deeper physical theories, and possibly uncovering new principles \u2013 like a true \u201csecond law of infodynamics\u201d \u2013 that govern the creation and demise of information in our universe. \n\n"

Mathematically, this \u201cno\u2010memory\u201d property forces the overall time\u2010evolution map \\(\\Gamma(t)\\) to factor as\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma(t) \\;=\\; \\Gamma(t \\!\\leftarrow\\! t') \\,\\Gamma(t'),\n\\]\n\nfor all \\(0 < t' < t\\).  This factorization property is precisely what is meant by *divisibility*:  one can \u201cdivide\u201d the evolution from \\(0\\) to \\(t\\) into an evolution from \\(0\\) to \\(t'\\) and another from \\(t'\\) to \\(t\\).  Put another way, when a process is Markovian, the transition over any interval can be composed of smaller\u2010interval transitions in a consistent (memoryless) way, and that compositional consistency is the hallmark of divisibility."

              "\u201cDivisibility\u201d refers to being able to break up the evolution from 0 to \\(t\\) into valid intermediate steps (e.g.\\ from 0 to \\(t'\\) and then \\(t'\\) to \\(t\\)), each of which has the same form of transition rules. The Markov assumption ensures exactly that sort of clean factorization, because memoryless dynamics do not \u201cremember\u201d intermediate states beyond the immediate past. \n\nAn *indivisible* process, on the other hand, fails that factorization: you *cannot* simply split its evolution at some \\(t'\\) and treat each piece as the same kind of transition. In effect, non\u2010Markov (memoryful) behavior breaks the neat composition law. That is why the condition of \u201cdivisibility\u201d is tightly connected to the Markov property\u2014when a process *is* Markov, it *is* divisible (and vice versa)."

In that sense, a distribution is \u201cinfinitely divisible\u201d if it can be represented as the sum of \\(n\\) i.i.d.\\ random variables for arbitrarily large \\(n\\). \n\nBy contrast, the \u201cdivisibility\u201d you see in Markov or quantum\u2010channel contexts has to do with the *factorization of time evolution operators* (e.g.\\ \\(\\Gamma(t) = \\Gamma(t \\!\\leftarrow\\! t') \\,\\Gamma(t')\\)). This notion says that the evolution from 0 to \\(t\\) can be broken into intermediate steps that \u201ccompose\u201d in a memoryless way. It does **not** require anything about summing random variables. \n\nSo while \u201cinfinite divisibility\u201d and \u201cdivisibility\u201d sound similar, they refer to two distinct ideas:\n1. **Infinite divisibility of a distribution**: writing a distribution as a sum of identical distributions.\n2. **Divisibility of a time evolution**: factorizing an overall time\u2010evolution map into smaller\u2010interval maps."

              "**Clarifying technical terms**\n\nI\u2019m working through defining an indivisible stochastic process, a concept from probability and measure theory, ensuring the explanation is strictly technical.\n\n**Clarifying terminology**\n\n\"Indivisible stochastic process\" seems less standard. It might indicate processes that cannot break down into simpler, independent components, akin to irreducible processes or indivisible random processes.\n\n**Clarifying the term**\n\nI\u2019m noting that \"indivisible\" likely means \"indecomposable\" in this context. An indivisible stochastic process cannot be divided into simpler independent processes, aligning with the notion of \"indecomposable\" in stochastic analysis.\n\n**Clarifying stochastic terms**\n\n\"Indivisible\" likely means a stochastic process that cannot be decomposed into simpler independent processes or lacks the property of independent increments. This contrasts with \"infinitely divisible\" processes.\n\n**Clarifying non-decomposability**\n\n\"Indivisible\" might refer to processes not distributable into smaller, independent parts, akin to \"atomic\" in probability theory, or \"extremal\" in the context of extremal processes.\n\n**Defining indivisibility**\n\nAn indivisible stochastic process is one that cannot be represented as a sum or superposition of two or more independent, non-trivial processes. This definition aligns with the concept of \"indecomposable\" in probability.\n\n**Clarifying indivisibility** \n\nAn indivisible stochastic process cannot be decomposed into a sum of two independent non-trivial processes. This concept is akin to 'prime' or 'indecomposable' elements in algebra.\n\n**Mapping the concept**\n\nAn indivisible stochastic process is one that cannot be expressed as a sum of two independent non-trivial processes, and its distribution, at any fixed time, is not infinitely divisible.\n\n**Clarifying indivisibility**\n\nIndivisible stochastic processes cannot be decomposed into infinitely divisible sums. Common distributions like normal and Poisson are infinitely divisible, so they do not fit this description.\n\n**Clarifying indivisibility**\n\nA stochastic process \\(X(t)\\) is indivisible if \\(X(t)\\) is not infinitely divisible for any time \\(t\\), meaning there is no independent sum representation of \\(X(t)\\) as the sum of \\(n\\) i.i.d. random variables.\n\n**Elucidating indivisibility**\n\nAn indivisible stochastic process is one where its finite-dimensional distributions cannot be represented as convolutions of non-trivial distributions, implying it is not infinitely divisible.\n\n**Clarifying definitions**\n\nAn indivisible stochastic process is one whose finite-dimensional distributions cannot be represented as convolutions of non-trivial distributions, meaning it is not infinitely divisible.\n\n**Clarifying the concept**\n\nAn indivisible stochastic process cannot be represented as a sum of independent identically distributed random variables, as one might try to do for infinitely divisible processes.\n\n**Clarifying indivisible**\n\nI'm working through the concept that an indivisible stochastic process lacks a nontrivial decomposition into independent subprocesses, suggesting it cannot be broken down into independent increments or distributions.\n\n**Clarifying indivisibility**\n\nAn indivisible stochastic process cannot be expressed as a sum of independent random variables, with at least one of the variables being trivial (like a constant), echoing the concept of prime numbers in arithmetic.\n\n**Clarifying indivisibility**\n\nAn indivisible stochastic process is one that cannot be decomposed into two independent non-trivial processes, meaning one of them must be almost surely constant. This aligns with the concept of indivisibility in arithmetic.\n\n**Understanding indivisibility and infinite divisibility**\n\nThis property of indivisibility contrasts with infinite divisibility, seen in classical processes like the Poisson and Brownian motions, which can be easily decomposed into sums of independent increments.\n\n**Finalizing the definition**\n\nI'm concluding that in stochastic processes, an indivisible process cannot be decomposed into a sum of two independent non-trivial processes, meaning one of them is always almost surely constant.\n\n**Understanding indivisibility**\n\nAn indivisible stochastic process cannot be split into two independent processes; one must be trivially constant. This mirrors prime numbers or indecomposable elements, which resist being broken down further."

              "**Exploring indivisible stochastic processes**\n\nI'm mapping out examples of indivisible stochastic processes, since most processes are either infinitely divisible or indecomposable. It\u2019s interesting to see that canonical examples are hard to find.\n\n**Examining indivisible processes**\n\nI'm decoding the definition of indivisible processes, noting their rarity and typically atomic nature, such as pure jump processes. This involves considering non-decomposable traits.\n\n**Defining indivisible processes**\n\nHmm, I\u2019m thinking about processes that resist decomposition into two independent components. Considering examples like pure jump processes and examining irreducibility properties to understand their indivisibility.\n\n**Piecing together indivisible characteristics**\n\nI'm pulling together that indivisible processes might lack infinite divisibility, often possessing \"prime\" attributes. This leads me to identify discrete processes like the Bernoulli process for instance.\n\n**Gathering nuances**\n\nInterestingly enough, indivisible processes are often not infinitely divisible, and typical examples include deterministic or atomic processes like the Bernoulli process.\n\n**Analyzing discrete non-divisible cases**\n\nMolteni is investigating discrete distributions, like binomial distributions, that are non-infinitely divisible, and he explains that finite-dimensional distributions can exhibit indivisibility as well.\n\n**Evaluating indivisibility**\n\nNow I'm focusing on Bernoulli distributions with parameters not equal to 0 or 1, as these are typically indivisible. Examining their one-dimensional distributions closely.\n\n**Examining Bernoulli sequences**\n\nI\u2019m curious about sequences of independent Bernoulli random variables and their indivisibility. While Bernoulli distributions are not infinitely divisible, the sequences might hold interesting decomposition properties.\n\n**Evaluating stochastic processes**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing stochastic processes, especially those with independent Bernoulli increments. Bernoulli sequences may be indivisible and trivial in decomposition. This leads me to reflect on their stochastic properties.\n\n**Investigating atomic processes**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the idea of \"atomic\" or \"prime\" processes, potentially indivisible, and \"indecomposable Markov processes,\" whose transition semigroup cannot be decomposed. This leads me to reflect on their unique characteristics.\n\n**Mapping Bernoulli sequences**\n\nI\u2019m examining independent Bernoulli variables as a time function and considering their potential indivisibility, contrasting with \"atomic\" or \"prime\" processes and \"indecomposable Markov processes.\"\n\n**Examining recurrent classes**\n\nI\u2019m noting that Markov chains with single recurrent classes differ from indivisible transitions, which are less commonly studied. Providing examples might illustrate these concepts more clearly.\n\n**Focusing on strong dependencies**\n\nI'm looking into indivisible processes in contexts with strong dependencies or non-additive structures, which make decomposition essentially trivial. Examples might illuminate these unique characteristics.\n\n**Evaluating process examples**\n\nI'm considering \"atomic\" or \"prime\" processes and \"indecomposable Markov processes\" to better understand indivisible transitions, noting that a single recurrent class Markov chain might not provide sufficient insight.\n\n**Examining indivisible processes**\n\nI'm thinking through indivisible processes, specifically those with strong dependencies or non-additive structures, like a discrete binomial distribution that isn't infinitely divisible.\n\n**Mapping out indivisible processes**\n\nI\u2019m examining processes with non-infinitely divisible distributions, like a compound process composed of independent increments that cannot be further decomposed, and noting the uniform distribution's divisibility characteristics.\n\n**Taking a closer look**\n\nInterestingly enough, the uniform distribution on an interval isn't infinitely divisible, except in trivial cases with a characteristic function that doesn't fit a L\u00e9vy exponent.\n\n**Clarifying indivisible processes**\n\nI\u2019m noting that if a process has a distribution with stationary independent increments, like a Bernoulli distribution, it remains indivisible due to the lack of infinite divisibility in the marginal distributions.\n\n**Identifying discrete dynamics**\n\nI\u2019m looking at discrete-time Bernoulli processes with independent increments, noting their indivisibility and questioning their well-defined nature in the context of continuous-time.\n\n**Recognizing indivisible traits**\n\nInterestingly enough, a Bernoulli process demonstrates indivisibility through its discrete-time paradigm, exhibiting stationary independent increments similar to certain continuous-time processes.\n\n**Revisiting indivisible process ideas**\n\nI\u2019m rethinking the examples of indivisible processes, noting that while the square of a Wiener process lacks independent increments, it could fit the indivisibility criterion depending on the context.\n\n**Understanding indivisibility**\n\nI\u2019m working through properties of distributions, noting that \"indecomposable\" might replace \"indivisible\" when a distribution is not infinitely divisible and non-degenerate, though this term isn't consistently used.\n\n**Revisiting measure theories**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards the concept of \"indecomposable probability measures\" in convolution semigroups, which parallels \"prime\" infinitely divisible distributions, revealing an intriguing overlap with classical probability theory.\n\n**Studying indecomposable measures**\n\nI\u2019m investigating \"indecomposable probability measures\" within convolution semigroups, noting their link to \"prime\" measures and the Khintchine decomposition, which provides examples of such measures.\n\n**Revisiting probability measures**\n\nI'm exploring \"indecomposable probability measures\" in convolution semigroups, their ties to \"prime\" measures, and the Khintchine decomposition, while noting that Gaussian and Poisson distributions are infinitely divisible.\n\n**Understanding indecomposable measures**\n\nI'm thinking through non-infinitely divisible distributions, specifically the binomial distribution, which usually lacks infinite divisibility except in trivial cases.\n\n**Examining binomial marginals**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through indivisible processes, like a discrete time Markov chain with binomial marginals. This leads me to explore finite independent random variables with a fixed number of summands.\n\n**Understanding indivisibility**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that a process with independent increments and a Bernoulli one-dimensional distribution is indivisible. This means it can't be expressed as a sum of two independent non-degenerate random variables.\n\n**Mapping out Bernoulli measures**\n\nI\u2019m noting that Bernoulli measures are indecomposable, except in cases where they become degenerate, aligning with their convolution properties and identifying them as a classic instance of such measures.\n\n**Assessing binomial increments**\n\nI'm gathering info on a process with binomial increments over time intervals, questioning if this fits the non-infinitely divisible criteria, and comparing it to a static Bernoulli random variable.\n\n**Clarifying independence**\n\nOK, let me see: a process with independent increments having a fixed binomial distribution isn't infinitely divisible due to characteristic function zeros. The sum of Bernoulli variables isn't infinitely divisible.\n\n**Breaking down binomials**\n\nI'm digging into the fact that, despite being expressed through sums of Bernoulli variables, binomial distributions with fixed trials are decomposable. They hold a special status beyond independence.\n\n**Confirming indecomposability**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that a binomial distribution with more than one trial is decomposible, while a Bernoulli distribution remains indecomposible unless it\u2019s degenerate. This highlights distinct properties and applications.\n\n**Investigating uniform distribution**\n\nI\u2019m gauging if the uniform distribution on [0,1] is indecomposible, leading to the conclusion that it cannot form non-trivial measures. This aligns with notions of indecomposible distributions.\n\n**Understanding uniform distribution**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together that the characteristic function of a uniform distribution on an interval has zeros. This suggests it\u2019s not infinitely divisible, fitting the criteria for an indecomposible distribution.\n\n**Verifying uniform distribution**\n\nI'm confirming that the uniform distribution is indecomposible with characteristic function zeros. This rules out independent increments leading to a L\u00e9vy process, given its infinitely divisible marginals.\n\n**Examining discrete-time processes**\n\nI'm exploring discrete-time processes with uniform increments. These processes are indivisible, as their one-dimensional distributions lack infinitely divisible characteristics, preventing decomposition into independent processes.\n\n**Tracing process characteristics**\n\nFor processes with stationary independent increments, infinite divisibility of the increments aligns with the process itself, supporting the idea of non-infinitely divisible processes.\n\n**Examining indivisible processes**\n\nDelving into discrete-time processes with Bernoulli random variables at each time step, if decomposition into independent variables yields a trivial result, the process is considered indivisible.\n\n**Understanding discrete processes**\n\nOK, let me see. The examples include a Bernoulli nontrivial marginal distribution and a discrete-time process with i.i.d. uniform increments on [\u2212a, a], highlighting unique distribution characteristics.\n\n**Whittling down options**\n\nIf I choose i.i.d. uniform increments, sum of two independents forms a triangular distribution, potentially decomposable, thus not fulfilling the indivisibility criteria for all time steps.\n\n**Reassessing indivisibility**\n\nI'm analyzing the indivisibility criterion, which hinges on finite-dimensional distributions being indecomposable. The convolution of two uniforms forming a triangular distribution might violate this for multiple time steps.\n\n**Verifying indivisibility**\n\nI\u2019m confirming the indivisibility property for each time step, ensuring that any decomposition into independent processes results in a trivial representation without compromising the finite-dimensional distributions.\n\n**Evaluating indivisibility**\n\nI'm realizing that the indivisibility criterion applies strictly to the process itself, not just the one-dimensional marginals. This distinction is crucial for maintaining the finite-dimensional distributions' integrity.\n\n**Revisiting definitions**\n\nTaking a closer look at the indivisibility property, it should be understood in terms of the process as a whole, not just its one-dimensional marginals. This ensures the integrity of finite-dimensional distributions.\n\n**Clarifying definitions**\n\nI'm mapping out that the indivisibility criterion applies to the entire process X(t), not just its one-dimensional marginals, ensuring the integrity of independent decompositions for all time steps.\n\n**Identifying indivisible processes**\n\nI'm confirming that processes with independent increments and non-infinitely divisible one-dimensional marginal distributions, such as non-trivial binomial or Bernoulli distributions, exemplify indivisible stochastic processes.\n\n**Focusing on finite-time processes**\n\nI'm working through the complexity of additive processes with independent increments, recognizing that their convolutional properties often lead to decomposability, which contradicts the indivisibility criterion for a fixed time process.\n\n**Refining the approach**\n\nConsidering that if the decomposition of X(t) is indeterminate, it might require further scrutiny. The goal is to pinpoint XX through comprehensive analysis and examination.\n\n**Revealing indivisible processes**\n\nI\u2019m curious about indivisible processes, often artificial, with non-infinitely divisible distributions. Tenacious exploration of indecomposable Markov chains and unique examples helps deepen our grasp of this intriguing concept.\n\n**Revisiting the concept**\n\nInterestingly enough, \"indecomposable Markov chains,\" which resist being split into independent subchains, don't quite align with the indivisibility criterion, suggesting a more tailored approach is needed.\n\n**Identifying indivisibility**\n\nOne-time-step Bernoulli processes showcase indivisibility, contrasting with infinitely divisible processes. This distinction clarifies the types of distributions potentially fitting the indivisibility criterion.\n\n**Examining transformations**\n\nI\u2019m mapping out how deterministic transformations of indecomposable random variables, like multiplying by a nonzero function, yield indivisible processes. This shows a clear pattern of transformation leading to indivisibility.\n\n**Spotting artificial examples**\n\nOK, let me see. Indivisible processes mainly come from custom-built stations with undecodable margins, like Bernoulli, as many natural processes are infinitely divisible.\n\n**Spotting artificial instances**\n\nFocusing on non-additive processes with deterministic transitions of undecodable random variables, like Bernoulli, highlights the uniqueness of these examples compared to infinite divisibility processes.\n\n**Considering disentanglements**\n\nI'm thinking through how natural probability processes often feature infinite divisibility. For example, decomposing a Bernoulli process forces one component into being degenerate.\n\n**Highlighting lesser-known aspects**\n\nI'm focusing on stochastic processes that are infinitely divisible. Simple examples of indivisible processes are rare, arising mostly for illustrative purposes.\n\n**Piecing together**\n\nI'm curious about discrete setups, particularly single-step processes with indecomposable marginals like Bernoulli random variables. Any attempt to decompose forces one part into being trivial.\n\n**Constructing indivisible processes**\n\nI\u2019m working through constructing indivisible processes by scaling an indecomposable random variable with a deterministic function, ensuring any decomposition forces one component to be trivial."

              "Below are a couple of examples that illustrate the notion of indivisibility in stochastic processes. (Keep in mind that many of the classical processes encountered in probability theory\u2014such as Brownian motion, Poisson processes, and other L\u00e9vy processes\u2014are in fact *infinitely divisible* rather than indivisible. In contrast, the following examples are typically constructed or found in discrete-time settings where the one\u2010dimensional distributions are chosen to be indecomposable.)\n\n---\n\n**1. A Single-Step Process with an Indecomposable Marginal**\n\nConsider a discrete-time process defined on the index set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\). Define\n\\[\nX(0)=0 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad X(1)=B,\n\\]\nwhere \\(B\\) is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter \\(p\\) (with \\(0<p<1\\)). The Bernoulli distribution is indecomposable in the following sense: if one assumes a representation\n\\[\nB \\stackrel{d}{=} Y + Z\n\\]\nwith \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) independent nondegenerate random variables, then necessarily one of \\(Y\\) or \\(Z\\) must be trivial (a Dirac mass). Thus, any representation of the process \\(X\\) as a sum\n\\[\nX(t) = Y(t) + Z(t) \\quad \\text{for } t\\in\\{0,1\\}\n\\]\nforces one of the processes \\(Y\\) or \\(Z\\) to be degenerate. This makes the process indivisible in the sense of our definition.\n\n---\n\n**2. A Process Defined by Deterministic Scaling of an Indecomposable Random Variable**\n\nLet \\(B\\) be an indecomposable random variable (again, for example, a Bernoulli random variable). Now define a process \\(\\{X(t)\\}_{t\\in T}\\) on some index set \\(T\\) by\n\\[\nX(t)=g(t)\\,B,\n\\]\nwhere \\(g(t)\\) is a deterministic function that is nonzero on a nontrivial subset of \\(T\\). In any proposed decomposition of the process,\n\\[\nX(t) = Y(t) + Z(t)\n\\]\nwith \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) independent processes, the only source of randomness is the random variable \\(B\\). Because \\(B\\) itself does not admit a nontrivial independent decomposition (by its indecomposability), it follows that one of the processes \\(Y\\) or \\(Z\\) must be trivial (identically zero, say) for all \\(t\\). Thus, the process \\(\\{X(t)\\}\\) is indivisible.\n\n---\n\n**A Few Remarks**\n\n- In these examples the key is that the one\u2010dimensional marginal (or \u201cbuilding block\u201d) distribution is indecomposable in the convolution sense\u2014that is, if\n  \\[\n  \\mu = \\nu * \\eta,\n  \\]\n  with \\(\\mu\\) being the law of \\(B\\), then either \\(\\nu\\) or \\(\\eta\\) must be a Dirac measure.\n\n- In contrast, many well\u2010known processes are constructed so that for any integer \\(n\\) the distribution of \\(X(t)\\) (or its increments) can be written as the \\(n\\)\u2013fold convolution of some law (this is the property of infinite divisibility). Thus, in classical stochastic process theory the emphasis is often on infinitely divisible models rather than on indivisible ones.\n\n- Explicit examples of nontrivial indivisible processes in continuous time are less common because the natural processes that arise (and have rich structure) are usually built to be infinitely divisible.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, while classical processes like Brownian motion and the Poisson process are not examples of indivisible processes, one may construct indivisible stochastic processes in discrete time by choosing indecomposable one\u2013dimensional marginals (such as the Bernoulli distribution) or by \u201cscaling\u201d an indecomposable random variable in a deterministic manner."

              "In probability theory, the *convolution* of two probability measures (or distributions) provides the distribution of the sum of two independent random variables. Let\u2019s break this down step by step.\n\n### Convolution of Distributions\n\nSuppose we have two independent random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with probability distributions \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu\\) respectively. The distribution of the sum \\(Z = X + Y\\) is given by the convolution of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu\\), which is denoted by \\(\\mu * \\nu\\).\n\nIf the random variables have probability density functions \\(f_X\\) and \\(f_Y\\) (assuming they exist), then the density \\(f_Z\\) of \\(Z\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nf_Z(z) = (f_X * f_Y)(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_X(y)\\, f_Y(z - y) \\, dy.\n\\]\nThis formula tells us that to find the probability density at a point \\(z\\) for the sum \\(Z\\), we integrate over all possible ways to split \\(z\\) into two parts, \\(y\\) and \\(z-y\\), weighting by the likelihoods \\(f_X(y)\\) and \\(f_Y(z-y)\\).\n\nIf we are working with probability measures (not necessarily having densities), the convolution is defined on any Borel set \\(A \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\) as:\n\\[\n(\\mu * \\nu)(A) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mu(A - y) \\, \\nu(dy),\n\\]\nwhere \\(A - y = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} : x + y \\in A \\}\\).\n\n### Decomposition via Convolution\n\nWhen we say that a probability distribution \\(\\mu\\) is decomposable, we mean that there exist two nontrivial probability distributions \\(\\nu\\) and \\(\\eta\\) (i.e., not degenerate) such that:\n\\[\n\\mu = \\nu * \\eta.\n\\]\nThis implies that if a random variable \\(X\\) has distribution \\(\\mu\\), then there exist independent random variables \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) with distributions \\(\\nu\\) and \\(\\eta\\) respectively such that:\n\\[\nX \\stackrel{d}{=} Y + Z.\n\\]\n\n### Indivisibility (or Indecomposability)\n\nA distribution \\(\\mu\\) is called *indecomposable* if it cannot be written as the convolution of two nontrivial distributions. In other words, if you assume that:\n\\[\n\\mu = \\nu * \\eta,\n\\]\nthen one of \\(\\nu\\) or \\(\\eta\\) must be a trivial distribution, usually represented by a Dirac delta measure (a point mass at some constant). A trivial (or degenerate) distribution corresponds to a random variable that is almost surely constant. Thus, for an indecomposable distribution, there is no nontrivial way to \"split\" the randomness into two independent parts.\n\n### Connection to Stochastic Processes\n\nFor a stochastic process \\(\\{X(t)\\}\\), if the marginal distribution at a given time \\(t\\) is indecomposable, then the process itself cannot be decomposed into a sum of two independent processes (each contributing nontrivial randomness). If such a decomposition were possible, then the marginal distribution at time \\(t\\) would be expressible as a convolution of the distributions of the two independent parts, contradicting the indecomposability of the marginal.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Convolution**: An operation that combines two distributions to yield the distribution of the sum of two independent random variables.\n- **Decomposable Distribution**: A distribution that can be expressed as a convolution of two nontrivial distributions.\n- **Indecomposable (Indivisible) Distribution**: A distribution for which any convolution representation \\(\\mu = \\nu * \\eta\\) forces one of the components (\\(\\nu\\) or \\(\\eta\\)) to be trivial (a Dirac delta measure).\n- **Implication for Stochastic Processes**: If the marginal distribution of a process at some time \\(t\\) is indecomposable, the process cannot be nontrivially decomposed into the sum of two independent processes.\n\nThis convolution perspective is central to understanding properties like infinite divisibility versus indivisibility in stochastic processes. Infinite divisibility means that for any positive integer \\(n\\), the distribution can be written as the convolution of \\(n\\) identical distributions, while indivisibility means no such nontrivial splitting is possible."

              "The convolution discussion is related to\u2014but distinct from\u2014the Markov assumption. Here\u2019s how they connect:\n\n1. **Convolution in Transition Probabilities:**  \n   In many Markov processes, the future state is determined by a transition probability that often has a convolution structure. For example, in time-homogeneous Markov processes with continuous state spaces, the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation expresses that the transition probability over a longer time interval can be obtained by \u201cconvolving\u201d the transition probabilities over shorter intervals. Formally, if \\( p(t, x; s, y) \\) denotes the transition kernel, then for \\( s < u < t \\):\n   \\[\n   p(t, x; s, y) = \\int p(t, x; u, z)\\, p(u, z; s, y)\\, dz.\n   \\]\n   This is analogous to the convolution of distributions: you integrate over all intermediate states, combining two \u201csteps\u201d of the process.\n\n2. **Indivisibility vs. Infinite Divisibility:**  \n   The convolution explanation we discussed earlier concerns whether a given distribution (say, at a fixed time or for an increment) can be decomposed as a convolution of two nontrivial distributions. A process whose one-dimensional marginal is *indecomposable* (or indivisible) cannot be split into a sum of independent nontrivial components.  \n   \n   On the other hand, many Markov processes\u2014especially those with independent increments like L\u00e9vy processes\u2014have the property of *infinite divisibility*. Infinite divisibility means that for any positive integer \\( n \\), the distribution can be written as the convolution of \\( n \\) identically distributed, nontrivial distributions. In this sense, infinite divisibility is the opposite of indivisibility.\n\n3. **The Markov Assumption Itself:**  \n   The Markov assumption states that the future evolution of the process depends only on the present state, not on the history. It is a statement about the conditional independence of future states given the current state. This assumption does not directly address whether the one-dimensional distributions are decomposable via convolution. A Markov process may well have transition probabilities that \u201cconvolve\u201d over time (as seen in the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation) but still have marginal distributions that are infinitely divisible.\n\n4. **Connecting the Two Concepts:**  \n   - **Markov processes and convolution:** In a Markov process with independent increments, the marginal distribution at a later time is obtained by convolving the distributions of the increments. The convolution structure here is a consequence of both the Markov property (which allows for a sequential update via the transition kernel) and the independence of increments.\n   - **Indivisibility in contrast:** When we say a process (or its marginal distribution) is indivisible, we mean it cannot be decomposed into a convolution of two nontrivial distributions. This is a structural property of the distribution itself, independent of any memory or history concerns. In many Markov processes, however, the increment distributions are chosen to be infinitely divisible, so they can be \u201csplit\u201d arbitrarily via convolution, which contrasts with indivisibility.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The **Markov assumption** is about the memoryless property of a process: the future is independent of the past given the present.  \n- The **convolution structure** arises in the calculation of transition probabilities (via the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation) and in the way independent increments combine.  \n- **Indivisibility** (or indecomposability) is a property of a distribution indicating it cannot be written as the convolution of two nontrivial distributions, whereas many Markov processes (especially those with independent increments) have infinitely divisible distributions.\n\nIn essence, while both concepts involve convolution, the Markov assumption is about how the process evolves in time (its conditional structure), whereas the convolution explanation regarding indivisibility is about the internal structure of the distribution of the process."

Its defining properties in the finite-dimensional setting are:\n\n1. **Initial condition:** \\( W(0) = 0 \\) almost surely.\n2. **Independent increments:** For any sequence of times \\( 0 \\le t_0 < t_1 < \\cdots < t_n \\), the increments\n   \\[\n   W(t_1) - W(t_0),\\, W(t_2) - W(t_1),\\, \\dots,\\, W(t_n) - W(t_{n-1})\n   \\]\n   are independent.\n3. **Stationary increments:** The distribution of any increment \\( W(t) - W(s) \\) depends only on the time difference \\( t-s \\); specifically,\n   \\[\n   W(t) - W(s) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\, t-s).\n   \\]\n4. **Continuity of paths:** With probability 1, the sample paths \\( t \\mapsto W(t) \\) are continuous.\n\nThese properties make the Wiener process the driving noise in SDEs, and its effect on the evolution of probability densities is encapsulated by the **Fokker\u2013Planck equation** (also known as the forward Kolmogorov equation), which describes how the probability density function of the state variable evolves over time.\n\n---\n\n### Representation in Infinite-Dimensional Systems\n\nIn infinite-dimensional settings\u2014such as those encountered when dealing with stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs)\u2014one must generalize the concept of Brownian motion to an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space \\( H \\). Here are the key ideas:\n\n1. **\\( Q \\)-Wiener Process:**  \n   An infinite-dimensional analogue of the Wiener process is often constructed as a *\\( Q \\)-Wiener process*. Let \\( Q \\) be a symmetric, positive (semi-)definite, and typically trace-class operator on \\( H \\). Then, a \\( Q \\)-Wiener process \\( W(t) \\) can be represented as\n   \\[\n   W(t) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\sqrt{\\lambda_k}\\, e_k\\, \\beta_k(t),\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( \\{e_k\\} \\) is an orthonormal basis of \\( H \\) consisting of eigenfunctions of \\( Q \\),\n   - \\( \\{\\lambda_k\\} \\) are the corresponding eigenvalues,\n   - \\( \\{\\beta_k(t)\\} \\) are independent standard one-dimensional Brownian motions.\n\n   The series converges in \\( H \\) (or in a suitable larger space) provided that the covariance operator \\( Q \\) is trace-class (i.e., \\( \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\lambda_k < \\infty \\)).\n\n2. **Cylindrical Wiener Process:**  \n   When \\( Q \\) is not trace-class, the above series might not converge in \\( H \\). In such cases, one often works with a *cylindrical Wiener process*. Although not a bona fide \\( H \\)-valued random variable in the usual sense, it can be understood as a formal series that, when paired with appropriate linear functionals or when integrated against a suitable operator, yields well-defined random variables.\n\n3. **Infinite-Dimensional Fokker\u2013Planck Equation:**  \n   In finite dimensions, the Fokker\u2013Planck equation governs the evolution of probability densities under the influence of drift and diffusion (the latter often being induced by Brownian motion). In infinite-dimensional spaces, one seeks to describe the evolution of probability measures on function spaces (or other infinite-dimensional spaces). The resulting Fokker\u2013Planck equation becomes a functional (or measure-valued) partial differential equation. Formulating and analyzing such equations requires advanced tools from functional analysis and measure theory, as there is no canonical \"Lebesgue measure\" in infinite dimensions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Finite Dimensions:** A Brownian (Wiener) process is a continuous, normally distributed process with independent, stationary increments, central to the formulation of SDEs and the corresponding Fokker\u2013Planck equations.\n- **Infinite Dimensions:** The concept is generalized to a \\( Q \\)-Wiener process in a Hilbert space via a series expansion involving eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a covariance operator. If the covariance operator is not trace-class, the process is treated as a cylindrical Wiener process. The associated Fokker\u2013Planck equation then describes the evolution of probability measures on these infinite-dimensional spaces.\n\nThis framework is fundamental when studying SPDEs and various problems in infinite-dimensional stochastic analysis."

              "**Answer (technical discussion, English only):**\n\nYes. The Fokker\u2013Planck equation (also called the forward Kolmogorov equation) *does* preserve total probability, even though it includes a diffusion term in addition to the drift term. It can still be viewed as a continuity equation in probability space, with a probability current (or probability flux) that now has both a drift part *and* a diffusion part. As long as boundary conditions are chosen so that probability cannot \u201cleak out,\u201d the integral of the probability density over all space remains 1 at all times.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Liouville vs. Fokker\u2013Planck\n\n- **Liouville equation (no diffusion)**:  \n  \\[\n    \\partial_t \\rho(x,t) = -\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[f(x)\\,\\rho(x,t)\\bigr],\n  \\]  \n  describes *deterministic* evolution in phase space (e.g., Hamiltonian systems). It simply says that the probability density \\(\\rho\\) is *advected* by the velocity/drift \\(f(x)\\), and no probability is created or destroyed; hence \\(\\int \\rho\\,dx\\) is constant in time.\n\n- **Fokker\u2013Planck equation (with diffusion)**:  \n  \\[\n    \\partial_t \\rho(x,t)\n    = -\\,\\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[f(x)\\,\\rho(x,t)\\bigr]\n      + \\nabla \\cdot \\bigl[D(x)\\,\\nabla \\rho(x,t)\\bigr],\n  \\]  \n  adds a diffusive flux term. In the simplest case, \\(D(x)\\) can be treated as a constant diffusion coefficient. This second term means that probability spreads out in state space due to random fluctuations, but it is still a purely conservative process when viewed globally: the probability \u201clost\u201d in one region is exactly the probability \u201cgained\u201d in neighboring regions.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Probability Conservation\n\nTo see that the Fokker\u2013Planck equation conserves probability, integrate \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) over the entire domain:\n\\[\n  \\frac{d}{dt}\\,\\int \\rho(x,t)\\,dx\n  \\;=\\;\\int \\partial_t \\rho(x,t)\\,dx.\n\\]\nSubstitute the Fokker\u2013Planck equation into the right-hand side. The integral of a divergence term typically becomes a surface/boundary integral (via the divergence theorem). If one imposes boundary conditions such that the probability current is zero at the boundaries (for example, periodic boundary conditions or sufficiently fast decay at infinity), then the boundary term vanishes. Thus, the time derivative of the total probability is zero, so the total probability remains 1 (assuming it was normalized initially).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Probability Conservation in SDEs\n\nWhen you have a stochastic differential equation (SDE),\n\\[\n  dX_t = f(X_t)\\,dt + \\sqrt{2\\,D(X_t)}\\,dW_t,\n\\]\nthe corresponding Fokker\u2013Planck equation describes how the *probability distribution* of \\(X_t\\) evolves in time. Even though each sample path of the SDE \u201cdiffuses\u201d (wanders around in the state space randomly), when considered as an *ensemble*, the total probability is still conserved\u2014there is no creation or destruction of random \u201cmass.\u201d The diffusion just redistributes probability in state space.\n\nFormally, one can derive the Fokker\u2013Planck (forward Kolmogorov) equation from the SDE and see that, provided the diffusion does not blow up at the boundaries (and boundary conditions are handled appropriately), the solution \\(\\rho(x,t)\\) remains normalized in time.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Yes**, the Fokker\u2013Planck equation enforces probability conservation, just like the Liouville equation, but with an added diffusion term.  \n- In the context of stochastic processes (SDEs), \u201cprobability conservation\u201d means the *total* probability over the entire domain remains 1. Each individual path can wander randomly, but the ensemble distribution remains normalized\u2014no probability is magically lost or gained."
