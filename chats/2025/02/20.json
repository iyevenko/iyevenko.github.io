              "The general three-body problem does not have a closed-form solution. In the late 19th century, mathematicians like Bruns and Poincar\u00e9 proved that, aside from the known conserved quantities (such as energy, momentum, and angular momentum), no additional algebraic integrals exist. This result means the system is non-integrable in a way that prevents expressing the solution in terms of a finite combination of standard functions and operations.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while a general closed-form solution is impossible, there are:\n- **Special cases** (like the restricted three-body problem or particular configurations such as Euler\u2019s collinear and Lagrange\u2019s equilateral solutions) where solutions can be found.\n- **Numerical methods** and perturbation techniques that allow us to approximate the motion of the bodies very accurately.\n\nSo, while we have \u201cunsolvability\u201d in the sense that no neat, universal formula exists for all three-body scenarios, the problem is not unsolvable in practice\u2014only in terms of a general analytic expression."

              "Your statement touches on a subtle and interesting point about fractals and computability. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n1. **Finite Precision Points:**  \n   When we talk about a \u201cfinite precision point\u201d (e.g., a point given by rational coordinates or a fixed number of digits), we mean the point is described with limited, discrete information.\n\n2. **Fractal Membership Problem:**  \n   For many fractals (like the Mandelbrot set), determining whether a given point lies inside can be challenging. Often, the algorithm involves iterating a function many times, and points near the boundary may require an arbitrarily large number of iterations to decide membership.\n\n3. **Decidability vs. Computation Time:**  \n   - **Decidability (in the Turing sense):** A problem is decidable if there exists an algorithm that always terminates with a correct yes/no answer. For many well-studied fractals, it\u2019s not proven (or sometimes believed not) that there is an algorithm that always halts in finite time for every point.\n   - **Practical Computation:** In practice, for many points (especially those far from the boundary) the algorithm quickly tells you if the point is inside or outside. However, for points very near the fractal\u2019s boundary, the algorithm might require an arbitrarily long computation before it can decide, which is sometimes informally described as \u201ctaking infinitely long.\u201d\n\n4. **Examples and Nuances:**  \n   - **Mandelbrot Set:** It is widely believed (and there\u2019s much evidence) that the Mandelbrot set is computable\u2014that is, there is an algorithm that can decide membership for any finite precision point. However, a rigorous proof is still missing. In any case, points near the boundary can force the algorithm to run for a very long time.\n   - **Other Fractals:** For some fractals or dynamical systems, the membership problem is known to be undecidable. This means that no algorithm can decide membership for every possible point in finite time.\n\n5. **Summary:**  \n   Your statement is correct in highlighting that for many fractals, especially when dealing with points on or near the intricate boundary, the computational process may not halt quickly\u2014and in some cases, the problem can indeed be undecidable in the strict Turing sense. However, it\u2019s important to distinguish between the practical issue of \u201ctaking an arbitrarily long time\u201d and the theoretical concept of undecidability.\n\nIn short:  \n- **Not all fractal membership problems are undecidable**\u2014for some, we expect a decision procedure exists (even if it\u2019s slow near the boundary).  \n- **For others, especially in more pathological cases, the problem is provably undecidable.**\n\nDoes this help clarify the nuance between \u201cundecidability\u201d and \u201carbitrarily long computation time\u201d when checking fractal membership?"

              "No, it\u2019s not necessarily undecidable. Many fractal sets are defined in a way that makes membership testing a decidable (and even efficient) process when the point is given with finite precision.\n\n**Example: The Middle\u2010Third Cantor Set**\n\nThe Cantor set is constructed by starting with the interval \\([0,1]\\) and iteratively removing the open middle third from every remaining interval. A number in \\([0,1]\\) is in the Cantor set if and only if its ternary (base\u20113) expansion does not contain the digit 1 (with the usual caveat about numbers that have two different expansions).\n\n- **Finite Precision:** If you have a point given with finite precision (say, a rational number or a floating\u2011point approximation), then you only have a finite number of digits. You can convert these digits to base\u20113 and check if any of them is 1.\n- **Decision Process:** Because the representation is finite, this check takes only finitely many steps. If no forbidden digit is found, you can decide the point is in the Cantor set; if a 1 appears, it\u2019s not in the set.\n\nThus, for the Cantor set, membership can be decided in a finite number of operations.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Not all fractal sets share this property. For example, while the Mandelbrot set is defined by a simple iterative procedure, deciding membership for some points (especially those near the boundary) can be extremely challenging and isn\u2019t known to be computable in finite time in a uniform way. However, many fractals defined by iterated function systems (like the Sierpinski triangle or the Cantor set) are \u201ccomputable sets,\u201d meaning that there is an algorithm that decides membership for any finite-precision input in a finite number of steps.\n\nSo, while some fractals pose computational difficulties, many have decidable membership tests\u2014making the answer \u201cno\u201d in general."

              "Yes\u2014there are several other examples of fractal sets with decidable membership tests for points given at finite precision. Here are a few notable ones:\n\n1. **Sierpinski Triangle:**  \n   The Sierpinski triangle is the attractor of an iterated function system (IFS) consisting of three affine contraction mappings. To decide whether a given finite precision point belongs to the triangle, you can determine which of the three smaller triangles (or \u201ccells\u201d) the point would lie in at each iteration. Because the construction is self\u2010similar and each step divides the region into a finite number of parts, you can decide membership in a finite number of steps for a point represented with finitely many digits.\n\n2. **Sierpinski Carpet:**  \n   Similar to the triangle, the Sierpinski carpet is generated by recursively removing the central square from a subdivided square. Given a point in the unit square with finite precision, you can express its coordinates in base\u20113 (or another appropriate base) and check at each stage whether it falls into one of the removed \u201choles.\u201d Since only a finite number of digits are available, you only need to check finitely many iterations to decide membership.\n\n3. **Other IFS-Defined Fractals:**  \n   More generally, any fractal that is the attractor of a contractive iterated function system (where the maps satisfy the open set condition) is a computable set. This means there is an algorithm that, given a point with finite precision, will decide in finitely many steps whether the point belongs to the fractal. Examples include variations of Cantor sets and other self-similar fractals.\n\nThe key point in all these examples is that the self-similar, recursive construction provides a clear procedure that only needs to examine a finite number of steps\u2014since the input is of finite precision\u2014to conclude whether the point is in the set."
