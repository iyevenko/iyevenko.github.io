              "First, let\u2019s clarify what it means for a network (or operator) to be *rotationally equivariant*:\n\n- A function/operator \\( f \\) is *rotationally equivariant* if applying a rotation \\(R\\) to the input and then applying \\( f \\) is the same as first applying \\( f \\) to the input and then applying the *corresponding* rotation to the output. Symbolically, for a rotation \\( R \\), we want  \n  \\[\n     f(R(x)) = R(f(x)).\n  \\]\n- A stronger condition, *rotational invariance*, would require that \\( f(R(x)) = f(x) \\) (the output doesn\u2019t change at all under rotation).\n\n---\n\n## 1. The discrete Laplacian kernel\n\nYou\u2019re using the 2D discrete Laplacian kernel:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -4 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s note a few properties:\n\n1. **4-fold rotation symmetry (by multiples of 90\u00b0):** If you rotate this kernel by 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, or 270\u00b0, you get the same matrix back. Indeed, all four orientations look the same:\n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n       0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       1 & -4 & 1 \\\\\n       0 & 1 & 0\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\quad\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n       0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       1 & -4 & 1 \\\\\n       0 & 1 & 0\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\quad \\dots\n   \\]\n2. **Reflectional symmetry:** Similarly, reflections about the center row/column or the diagonals also yield the same kernel.\n\nHence, the 2D Laplacian kernel indeed has 8 symmetries (4 rotations \\(\\times\\) 2 reflections), so it is equivariant under those 8 transformations in the discrete sense.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Equivariance to *continuous* (arbitrary) rotations\n\nBecause the kernel is only explicitly unchanged under 90\u00b0 (and multiples thereof) rotations, it does **not** have continuous rotational symmetry. For an arbitrary angle \\(\\theta\\) that is *not* a multiple of \\(90^\\circ\\), the rotated version of the kernel\n\n\\[\n  \\text{rot}_\\theta \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    1 & -4 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nwill *not* match the original matrix entries on the same grid points. The discrete grid alignment shifts and interpolates differently, so you lose exact equivalence. \n\nThus, **a single-layer \u201cLaplacian filter + bias + nonlinearity\u201d is only guaranteed to be equivariant under those discrete 90\u00b0 rotations/reflections**. It is *not* equivariant to arbitrary (continuous) rotations.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Stacking five layers\n\nYour CNN has five layers, each of which applies:\n1. The same Laplacian 3\u00d73 convolution kernel  \n2. Bias  \n3. Nonlinearity  \n\nEven if each layer\u2019s kernel has 4-fold rotational symmetry, stacking multiple layers does *not* introduce continuous rotational symmetry. In fact, unless you specifically design a steerable network that can handle continuous orientation changes (e.g., using steerable filters, group-equivariant networks, or continuous kernel methods), you only preserve **the same discrete symmetries** layer to layer.\n\nHence, your 5-layer Laplacian-based CNN remains **equivariant to 90\u00b0 rotations and reflections**, but **not** to all arbitrary angles.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary\n\n- **Is it equivariant to any 90\u00b0 rotation or flip?** Yes.  \n- **Is it equivariant to *continuous* rotations (i.e., any real angle \\(\\theta\\))?** No, because each 3\u00d73 Laplacian kernel only has 4-fold rotational symmetry on a discrete grid and does not maintain exact alignment for non-90\u00b0 rotations. Stacking multiple layers does not magically extend that symmetry to all angles."

              "Designing a 2D rotation-equivariant CNN means building a network whose output transforms in a predictable way under *all* planar rotations (not just discrete 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0). Standard convolutions on a square grid are *translationally* equivariant but *not* rotationally equivariant. Achieving *exact* or *steerable* rotation equivariance typically involves:\n\n1. **Using the group of 2D rotations (SO(2))** (or a discrete subgroup) in the convolution definition  \n2. **Constraining filters to \u201csteerable\u201d forms** that can be rotated continuously within the convolution operation  \n\nBelow are the main approaches:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Group Equivariant Convolutional Networks (G-CNNs)\n\n**Key idea**: Convolution is generalized from translations to *group* convolutions. Instead of convolving over \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\) alone, you convolve over pairs \\((x, g)\\) where \\(g\\) is an element of a group (e.g., rotation).  \n\n- For 2D rotations, this group can be **\\( p4 \\) or \\( p4m \\)** (the wallpaper groups supporting discrete 90\u00b0 rotations/reflections) or the continuous group \\(\\mathrm{SO}(2)\\).  \n- In practice, you store feature maps not just as functions \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^C\\), but as functions \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\times G \\to \\mathbb{R}^C\\). Then each convolution is done over both position and group elements.  \n\nThis was introduced in the seminal paper by **Taco Cohen & Max Welling, \u201cGroup Equivariant Convolutional Networks,\u201d ICML 2016**. If you restrict the group to discrete rotations/reflections (like the dihedral group), you get exact *discrete* rotation/reflection equivariance.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Steerable CNNs\n\n**Key idea**: Constrain filters to a class of functions that can be \u201csteered\u201d (rotated) continuously. \n\n1. **Representation theory**: A steerable filter is designed so that rotating the input feature map by an angle \\(\\theta\\) can be implemented by a *linear* transformation of the filter/feature channels.  \n2. **Harmonic networks / circular harmonics**: One practical way is to expand filters in a basis of circular harmonics (complex exponentials) so that rotating a filter corresponds to shifting its phase.  \n3. **Steerable kernels**: In 2D, you can build filters from radial profiles multiplied by harmonic functions \\(e^{in\\phi}\\), ensuring that each filter can be analytically rotated to any angle.\n\nA key set of references here:  \n- **\u201cLearning Steerable Filters for Rotation Equivariant CNNs\u201d** by Weiler et al. (CVPR 2018).  \n- **\u201c3D Steerable CNNs\u201d** by Weiler et al. (NeurIPS 2018).  \n- **\u201cGeneral E(2)-Equivariant Steerable CNNs\u201d** by Weiler & Cesa (NeurIPS 2019).  \n\nThese networks guarantee *continuous* rotation equivariance (in theory) by construction, because each layer\u2019s filters and nonlinearities are built to transform appropriately under any rotation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical Steps to Build a 2D Rotation-Equivariant CNN\n\n1. **Pick a group**:  \n   - For *exact* continuous rotation equivariance, you want \\( \\mathrm{SO}(2) \\).  \n   - If you only need *discrete* rotations, you can use the dihedral group \\(D_N\\) for \\(N\\)-fold rotations and reflections, which is simpler to implement.  \n\n2. **Represent feature maps properly**:  \n   - In *Group Convolution* frameworks, each layer\u2019s feature maps is a function \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\times G \\to \\mathbb{R}^{C}\\).  \n   - In *Steerable CNN* frameworks, each \u201cchannel\u201d is actually a *steerable field*, meaning it transforms under rotation by a known representation (often using irreps of \\(\\mathrm{SO}(2)\\)).  \n\n3. **Define G-convolution or Steerable kernels**:  \n   - G-convolution: a sum over both spatial positions and group elements, ensuring the layer is equivariant.  \n   - Steerable kernels: parameterize filters by radial and angular components (e.g., Bessel functions, circular harmonics) so they can be continuously rotated.  \n\n4. **Use the right nonlinearities / activation functions**:  \n   - Nonlinearities must respect the group structure. Common choices are modulus nonlinearity on complex feature maps, or carefully designed real-valued \u201cgated\u201d nonlinearities in steerable CNNs.  \n\n5. **Implement / reuse specialized libraries**:  \n   - Libraries like **e2cnn** (for PyTorch) handle much of the group/steerable machinery automatically.  \n   - For a simpler discrete rotation version, you can implement your own \u201crotate the filters and stack\u201d approach.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Are These Methods Perfectly Rotation-Equivariant in Practice?\n\n- **On discrete pixel grids**, *exact* continuous rotation equivariance can only be realized *up to interpolation effects*, but steerable filters can get arbitrarily close.  \n- **Floating-point / interpolation**: Slight numerical approximations appear when rotating the feature maps during training or inference.  \n- **Sampling**: If your input is on a rigid grid, rotations by angles not multiple of 90\u00b0 need interpolation.  \n\nDespite minor practical nuances, group-equivariant or steerable CNNs vastly outperform standard CNNs for tasks where rotation is critical (e.g., medical imaging, certain physics problems, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nTo make a 2D rotation-equivariant CNN:\n\n1. **Use group-based or steerable convolution layers** specifically designed for \\(\\mathrm{SO}(2)\\) (continuous) or a discrete subgroup of rotations.  \n2. **Constrain your filters** (and feature channels) so they transform in a predictable, mathematically consistent way under rotations.  \n3. **Leverage existing open-source libraries** (e.g., **e2cnn**) that implement these group/steerable convolutions so you don\u2019t have to build everything from scratch.  \n\nThis ensures that rotating the input results in a *rotated version of the output*, giving you the true rotation *equivariance* that standard CNNs lack."

              "**Mapping the options**  \nI\u2019m thinking through different discrete Laplacian approximations, like the 3x3 and 5x5 kernels. The 3x3 kernel seems standard, but the 5x5 might offer better rotational symmetry for continuous rotation.\n\n**Wondering through kernel options**  \nI\u2019m thinking through various 3x3 Laplacian configurations, weighing their diagonal neighbors. The \"improved isotropic\" 3x3 kernel particularly stands out, needing scaling to zero the sum.\n\n**Piecing together alternatives**  \nI\u2019m mapping out a 9-point Laplacian stencil incorporating diagonals, with specific weights for the center, neighbors, and corners. This is an interesting enhancement over the standard 5-point stencil.\n\n**Tweaking the kernel**  \nI\u2019ve adjusted the 3x3 kernel to ensure the sum is zero, setting the center weight to -12. I\u2019ll add a normalization factor to achieve a center weight of -1.\n\n**Spotting the optimal fit**  \nI\u2019m considering the 9-point Laplacian kernel, with center weight -12, direct neighbors 2, and corners 1. It's more isotropic than the standard 5-point stencil.\n\n**Assessing kernel choices**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together the standard 3x3 9-point isotropic Laplacian kernel, centering it to -12, edges to 2, and corners to 1. This setup clearly shows a significant progression.\n\n**Considering radial symmetry**\n\nI'm evaluating a 5x5 radial symmetry approach for the Laplacian kernel, potentially incorporating higher-order accuracy for PDE solvers or a straightforward discrete kernel for second-order accuracy.\n\n**Analyzing symmetry**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the 9-point Laplacian kernel for its isotropic nature, aiming for a rotationally equivariant second derivative approximation. Nested application five times would enhance symmetry.\n\n**Mapping out symmetry**\n\nI\u2019m working through a 5x5 kernel, a truncated radial function in the Fourier domain, to maintain radial symmetry after repeated applications, with a focus on the Laplacian operator.\n\n**Weighing symmetry**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) is more rotationally symmetric. The 9-point Laplacian, with a center of -8 and corners of 1, stands out for its isotropy.\n\n**Adjusting weights**\n\nI\u2019m tweaking the 9-point Laplacian scheme: direct neighbors get weight 1, diagonals a fractional weight, and the center is the negative sum of the neighbors, aiming for symmetry.\n\n**Let's break this down**\n\nI'm examining the 9-point Laplacian. Direct edges are weighted 1, corners are weighted 1/4. The refined formula now includes these contributions.\n\n**Enhancing isotropy**\n\nI\u2019m refining the 9-point Laplacian kernel to ensure isotropy. With weights of 1 for direct neighbors and 1/4 for corners, this revision should improve symmetry.\n\n**Refining the kernel**\n\nScaling the 9-point Laplacian to achieve zero sum, I\u2019m ensuring the center weight is -12, with each direct neighbor at 1/3. This configures the discrete Laplacian effectively.\n\n**Evaluating kernel choices**\n\nI'm concluding that the 9-point Laplacian kernel is likely the optimal choice for a 3x3 kernel, offering the lowest anisotropy and standard discretization. For 5x5, a stencil or higher-order approach might be considered.\n\n**Advancing kernel design**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on a 5x5 scheme, potentially a 25-point approach, to achieve fourth-order accuracy for the Laplacian, extending high-order approximations from one dimension to two.\n\n**Balancing accuracy and symmetry**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a 5x5, 25-point Laplacian scheme for fourth-order accuracy, balanced with rotational symmetry. This ensures the kernel's rotational invariance is robust.\n\n**Crafting a rotationally invariant kernel**\n\nI'm working on mapping out coefficients for each ring to ensure rotational symmetry. This involves defining an error function to approximate \\(-k^2\\) in the frequency domain and solving for the kernel weights.\n\n**Ensuring rotational symmetry**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that the best discrete Laplacian for rotational equivariance is the 9-point approach for 3x3, with weights 1, 2, and 1 for direct neighbors, and 2, -12, and 2 for the center.\n\n**Analyzing kernel options**\n\nI\u2019m mapping out two discrete Laplacian kernels: a 3x3 \"9-Point Isotropic Laplacian\" and a 5x5 variant potentially for higher isotropic accuracy. This makes me think we\u2019re focusing on symmetry.\n\n**Advancing kernel design**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together a ring-based approach, assigning weights to center, direct neighbors, and ring-2 neighbors, while excluding complex distance categories for a more streamlined method.\n\n**Weighing kernel options**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards the 9-point approach for simplicity. Despite the 13-point method's complexity and its use in PDE solvers, the 9-point kernel seems the most straightforward and effective.\n\n**Weighing kernel choices**\n\nI'm gathering info on discrete Fourier optimization for the 5x5 kernel, considering both the 9-point approach and the 13-point method, typically reserved for PDE solvers.\n\n**Evaluating methods**\n\nOK, let me see. The 9-point method stands out for 3x3, while the 13-point approach, used in PDE solvers, could be optimal for 5x5, though it's more complex to define.\n\n**Pinpointing the best match**\n\nI'm working through the 9-point 2D Laplacian for 3x3 as the simplest, while for 5x5, a detailed ring-based weights set or PDE reference is likely ideal."

              "Below is a concise answer, followed by more detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Short Answer\n\n- **Best 3\u00d73 \u201cisotropic\u201d Laplacian kernel** (often called the *9\u2011point Laplacian* or *isotropic 3\u00d73 stencil*):\n  \\[\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n      1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n      2 & -12 & 2 \\\\\n      1 & 2 & 1\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n  (Optionally scaled by some constant factor so the center is \\(-1\\) or \\(-12\\), etc.)\n\n- **Best 5\u00d75 kernel** requires a more involved \u201c25\u2011point\u201d stencil or a frequency-domain optimization, but the key idea is to distribute positive weights in (roughly) concentric rings around the center so that:\n  1. The filter remains radially symmetric on the grid,\n  2. The sum of all weights is 0,\n  3. It best approximates \\(-k^2\\) in the Fourier domain (the continuous Laplacian).\n\nEither way, the 3\u00d73 or 5\u00d75 should be **radially symmetric** on the discrete grid (all points at the same distance from center get the same weight). The 9\u2011point 3\u00d73 kernel above is the simplest well-known choice that is **more isotropic** (and thus closer to continuous rotational symmetry) than the standard 5\u2011point \u201ccross\u201d Laplacian \\(\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & -4 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n\n---\n\n## Why the Standard 3\u00d73 \u201cCross\u201d Laplacian Is Less Isotropic\n\nThe commonly used Laplacian kernel:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -4 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nonly samples the four orthogonal neighbors. It completely ignores diagonals. As a result, if you apply it repeatedly (like convolving 5 times), you get noticeable *anisotropy* (the output \u201cdiffuses\u201d more along axes than along diagonals).\n\n---\n\n## A More Isotropic 3\u00d73 Kernel\n\nA better 3\u00d73 approximation (the so-called *9\u2011point Laplacian*) includes diagonal neighbors with slightly smaller weights, leading to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Kernel} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n2 & -12 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\\text{(sum of all entries = 0).}\n\\]\n\n- Center weight: \\(-12\\)  \n- Orthogonal neighbors: \\(+2\\)  \n- Diagonal neighbors: \\(+1\\)  \n\nYou can also multiply or divide the entire kernel by a constant factor if you want a particular \u201cscale\u201d (e.g. center = \\(-1\\) or \\(-12\\)).  What matters are the **relative** weights and that their total sum is zero.\n\nThis kernel is significantly more isotropic, so **repeated convolution** with it will behave more like the continuous Laplacian \\(\\nabla^2\\) for small grid spacing. It still is not *perfectly* rotation-invariant (that\u2019s impossible on a square grid), but it is *closer* to circular symmetry than the standard 5-point stencil.\n\n---\n\n## A (Much) More Isotropic 5\u00d75 Kernel\n\nIf you want to go to a 5\u00d75 kernel, you can approximate the Laplacian even more accurately by including additional rings of neighbors\u2014again ensuring the sum of weights is zero and that weights depend only on radius \\(\\sqrt{\\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2}\\).  One systematic way is:\n\n1. **Define rings**: \\((\\Delta x, \\Delta y)\\) such that \\(r^2 = \\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2\\).  \n2. **Assign a single weight** \\(w_r\\) to all points at distance \\(r\\).  \n3. **Solve** for these weights so that \\(\\sum w_r = 0\\) and so that the discrete filter best matches \\(-k^2\\) in the 2D Fourier domain.\n\nIn practice, you end up with something like:\n\n- Center (distance 0) has a large negative weight.  \n- The first ring (\\(r=1\\)) and second ring (\\(r=\\sqrt{2}\\)) get positive weights.  \n- Possibly the ring at \\(r=2\\) (the corners of a 5\u00d75) gets either zero or a smaller weight, depending on the optimization.  \n\nSuch stencils appear in higher-order PDE solvers.  They are more isotropic than any 3\u00d73 approach but also more complex.  If you only want \u201ca single best known 5\u00d75,\u201d you typically have to look up finite-difference PDE references or do a quick least-squares fit in the frequency domain.  There\u2019s no single canonical 5\u00d75 the way there is a well-known 9\u2011point 3\u00d73.\n\n---\n\n## Does Nesting It 5 Times Help?\n\nRepeated application of a **more isotropic** kernel will still preserve that extra isotropy with each application.  If you use the 9\u2011point 3\u00d73 above (or a well-designed 5\u00d75), each repeated convolution more closely mimics the continuous process \\(\\exp(t \\nabla^2)f\\) (i.e. heat equation) in an *isotropic* manner, compared to the simpler cross-shaped Laplacian.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n1. **If you must use 3\u00d73**:  \n   - Use the \u201c9\u2011point stencil,\u201d  \n   \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n       1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n       2 & -12 & 2 \\\\\n       1 & 2 & 1\n     \\end{bmatrix},\n   \\]\n   which is significantly more rotationally symmetric than the standard \\(\\begin{bmatrix}0&1&0\\\\1&-4&1\\\\0&1&0\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n\n2. **If you can go 5\u00d75**:  \n   - Construct a radially symmetric 5\u00d75 kernel (sum of weights = 0) by assigning distinct weights to each distance ring and possibly optimizing them in the frequency domain for best \\(-k^2\\) approximation.  There is no single universal \u201cnamed\u201d kernel here, but PDE references or a small numerical optimization can yield a good one.\n\nNeither of these is *perfectly* rotation-equivariant on a square grid, but they are **as close as you can get** with standard discrete filters."

This leads me to a streamlined and effective conclusion.\n\n**Crafting the kernel**\n\nIn this concise 5x5 kernel-building code, I use SciPy's least squares for optimization. Defining ring sets and frequency domain sampling ensures the kernel's coherence and precision.\n\n**Zeroing in on the kernel**\n\nPiecing together the kernel involves nailing down ring distances, setting up ring indices, and sealing constraints.

Enforces **\\(\\sum \\text{(kernel)} = 0\\)** by adding that as a constraint (the last element in the residual vector).  \n\nAt the end, `kernel_5x5` is a 5\u00d75 NumPy array whose entries sum to (nearly) zero and which best approximates an *isotropic* Laplacian on a 5\u00d75 support.  You can see the final numeric weights by running the script.  Typically:\n\n- The **center** will be a large negative number,  \n- **Nearby rings** will have positive weights, and  \n- Possibly an outer ring or corners might have smaller positive/negative weights,  \n- Ensuring total sum is zero.\n\nYou can optionally **rescale** the entire kernel so its center weight is exactly \\(-1\\) or any other desired magnitude.\n\n---\n\n## Notes & Tweaks\n\n1. **Sampling frequencies**: You can adjust `Nfreq` and the range of \\((k_x, k_y)\\) to focus on certain frequencies.  \n2. **More rigorous PDE approximations**: In PDE literature, high\u2010order finite\u2010difference or finite\u2010volume stencils on larger supports can be derived analytically or via optimization for isotropy.  \n3. **Exact continuous rotation\u2010equivariance is impossible** on a square grid, but this stencil is about as close as you can get in a 5\u00d75 footprint.\n\nUse or modify this code as a starting point for generating your own radially symmetric 5\u00d75 Laplacian filters!"

Each ring is associated with a specific distance.\n\n**Assigning weights**\n\nOK, I'm working through assigning a weight to each ring. The diagonal ring gets zero, as focusing on other rings better approximates the Laplacian, balancing the sum-to-zero constraint.\n\n**Assessing isotropy**\n\nI'm checking if focusing on the frequency domain can lead to the best solution, even if it seems anisotropic. The diagonal ring weight is zero, aiming for the least squares approximation.\n\n**Understanding grid patterns**\n\nI'm noting the grid's symmetry and the diagonal and corner weights. This reveals the trade-off between isotropy and computational efficiency in achieving a good solution.\n\n**Analyzing diagonal weights**\n\nIt's interesting to see that each pixel in the center ring has a value of zero. This unusual configuration was determined using a least squares technique, fitting a quadratic function to the data.\n\n**Gathering insights**\n\nI\u2019m curious about the kernel's weight distribution, especially the zero weights on the diagonals. It\u2019s interesting that this pattern aligns with the least squares solver's optimal solution in the frequency domain.\n\n**Adjusting parameters**\n\nI'm thinking about how modifying frequencies or weight functions might steer the solution away from an anisotropic outcome, aiming to better match the kernel's least squares approximation."

              "Below is a conceptual explanation for **why the solver ended up with zero (or near\u2010zero) weights** on the diagonal, and why that does **not** necessarily mean the kernel is \u201cbad\u201d or highly anisotropic in the sense of the optimization objective.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How the Code Works in Brief\n\nRecall that the code:\n\n1. **Groups all (x, y) pixels** in a 5\u00d75 patch into \u201crings\u201d of equal Euclidean distance \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\) from the center.  \n2. Assigns **a single scalar weight** \\(w_i\\) for each distinct ring \\(i\\).  \n3. **Least\u2010squares fits** those weights so the *discrete* filter\u2019s frequency response matches (in a least\u2010squares sense) the *continuous* Laplacian\u2019s frequency response \\(-|k|^2\\).  \n4. Enforces the constraint that the sum of all filter values is zero (the discrete Laplacian property).\n\nIn a 5\u00d75, there happen to be 6 distinct distance \u201crings\u201d from the center \\((0,0)\\) up to \\((2,2)\\). Each ring is free to have a positive, negative, or zero weight. Nothing in the math *forces* each ring\u2019s weight to be nonzero.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the Diagonal Ring Can End Up at Zero\n\nDuring the least\u2010squares optimization, certain rings\u2019 weights can settle at (or near) zero if that combination of weights **minimizes the frequency\u2010domain error** best.  \n\nIn your resulting kernel, you noticed it has big positive weights on the orthogonal neighbors (left/right/up/down) and zero on the diagonals.  This might feel \u201canisotropic\u201d in real space, but the code is optimizing for a *frequency\u2010domain* objective:\n\n\\[\n\\text{minimize} \\quad \\sum_{k_x, k_y} \\left\\lvert \\hat{L}_\\text{discrete}(k_x, k_y) - \\bigl(-|k|^2\\bigr)\\right\\rvert^2,\n\\]\nsubject to \\(\\sum \\text{(kernel)} = 0\\).\n\nBecause of the interplay among all rings, it can sometimes turn out that adding diagonal weights does *not* improve the fit (or even worsens it) under the chosen frequency sampling and constraint. The solver concludes \u201cbest\u201d is to set diagonal weights effectively to zero.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Is This Really \u201cHighly Anisotropic\u201d?\n\nIt *looks* anisotropic in real space (indeed, it\u2019s shaped like a cross). But remember:\n\n1. **Least\u2010squares in the frequency domain** focuses on matching \\(\\hat{L}_\\text{discrete}(k_x, k_y)\\) to \\(-(k_x^2 + k_y^2)\\) for a chosen grid of frequencies \\((k_x, k_y)\\).  \n2. A purely \u201ccross\u2010shaped\u201d operator can still approximate the Laplacian\u2019s radial spectrum decently *for those sample frequencies*, especially if the solver found that combination best satisfies the zero\u2010sum constraint plus the frequency match.  \n3. Sometimes a *small* tweak to how you sample frequencies, or adding additional constraints (like \u201cwe really want the diagonal ring to be non\u2010zero\u201d), can produce a more visually \u201cround\u201d kernel.\n\nHence, \u201canisotropic\u201d in pixel\u2010space does not always equal \u201clarge error\u201d in the *frequency domain* sense, especially if the main frequencies that matter (low to mid frequencies, say) are already well\u2010matched by the cross weights plus the center.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to Force Nonzero Diagonal Weights\n\nIf you truly want a more visually \u201cring\u2010like\u201d kernel, you can:\n\n1. **Sample more frequencies** or different weighting of frequencies, which sometimes encourages diagonal involvement.  \n2. **Add a small penalty** that enforces \u201csmoothness\u201d or non\u2010zero diagonal weights to bias the solver toward distributing the weights more evenly around the center.  \n3. **Use a bigger grid** (7\u00d77 or 9\u00d79) or a different PDE\u2010theory\u2013based derivation, which often yields more \u201cring\u2010like\u201d stencils.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Bottom Line\n\n- The solver is free to make the diagonal weights zero if that reduces the *overall frequency\u2010domain least\u2010squares error* given the constraint \\(\\sum w = 0\\).  \n- A visually \u201ccross\u2010shaped\u201d kernel *may* still do a good job (for that frequency sampling) of approximating \\(\\nabla^2\\).  \n- If you want to guarantee diagonal contributions, you need either (a) a larger support or (b) additional constraints or (c) a different frequency sampling/weighting.  \n\nSo while it *looks* surprising at first (and indeed not perfectly \u201cvisually isotropic\u201d), this zero\u2010on\u2010the\u2010diagonals result simply indicates that the solver found that solution to best fit the frequencies it was given in the objective."

              "Below is an overview of how *steerable* (rotation-equivariant) kernels can be constructed in 2D using a **harmonic expansion** (circular harmonic basis). The main idea is:\n\n1. Express your convolution kernel \\(\\kappa(\\mathbf{x})\\) in polar coordinates \\((r,\\phi)\\) around its center.\n2. Expand \\(\\kappa\\) in a suitable **radial** basis and **angular** (harmonic) basis so that it can be \u201csteered\u201d (i.e., rotated continuously) by a simple transformation of its coefficients.\n3. Use these harmonics to build *small*, radially parameterized (or partially radial) basis kernels that *by construction* are (approximately) rotation equivariant.\n\nBelow is the step-by-step mathematical picture.\n\n---\n\n# 1. The Steerable Kernel in Polar Coordinates\n\nConsider a 2D convolution kernel \\(\\kappa(\\mathbf{x})\\), where \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\). Let \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) be written in polar coordinates \\((r,\\phi)\\):\n\\[\n  \\mathbf{x} \n  = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} \n  \\;\\longleftrightarrow\\;\n  r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \n  \\quad\n  \\phi = \\tan^{-1}\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{y}{x}\\bigr).\n\\]\nA *steerable* (rotatable) kernel is one for which applying a rotation \\(\\theta\\) to the input simply corresponds to rotating the kernel by \\(\\theta\\) in \\emph{its internal representation}.  \n\nWe want a function \\(\\kappa(r,\\phi)\\) that can be \u201csteered\u201d easily:\n\n\\[\n  \\kappa(r,\\phi - \\theta) \n  \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad\n  \\text{rotation by }\\theta.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n# 2. Harmonic (Angular) Expansion\n\nA standard approach is to expand \\(\\kappa(r, \\phi)\\) in an **angular Fourier series** (harmonics). Let us write:\n\n\\[\n  \\kappa(r,\\phi)\n  \\;=\\;\n  \\sum_{n = -N}^{N} \n    R_{n}(r)\\,e^{\\,i\\,n\\,\\phi},\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the *angular frequency* (the harmonic index).\n- \\(R_{n}(r)\\) is some *radial function* that depends only on \\(r\\).\n\nThis complex exponential basis \\(e^{i\\,n\\,\\phi}\\) allows for straightforward *steering*. Indeed, to rotate the kernel by angle \\(\\theta\\), we do:\n\n\\[\n  \\kappa\\bigl(r,\\,\\phi - \\theta\\bigr)\n  \\;=\\;\n  \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} R_{n}(r)\\,e^{\\,i\\,n\\,(\\phi - \\theta)}\n  \\;=\\;\n  \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} \n      R_{n}(r)\\,e^{-\\,i\\,n\\,\\theta}\\,e^{\\,i\\,n\\,\\phi}.\n\\]\nSo the effect of rotation is just multiplying each angular harmonic\u2019s coefficient by \\(e^{-\\,i\\,n\\,\\theta}\\). This is the core mechanism behind steerability.\n\n### Real-Valued vs. Complex Filters\n\nOften we want real-valued filters. One way is to split each complex exponential into cosines and sines:\n\\[\n  e^{i\\,n\\,\\phi} \n  = \\cos(n\\phi) \\;+\\; i\\,\\sin(n\\phi),\n\\]\nso a real filter might look like:\n\\[\n  \\kappa(r, \\phi)\n  = a_0(r) \\;+\\;\n    \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \n    \\bigl(\n      a_{n}(r)\\cos(n\\phi)\n      \\;+\\;\n      b_{n}(r)\\,\\sin(n\\phi)\n    \\bigr),\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_n(r), b_n(r)\\) are real-valued radial profiles. Steering still works almost identically, except each \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\sin\\) component picks up a phase shift.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Radial Functions\n\nNow the question is how to represent (or learn) the *radial part* \\(R_{n}(r)\\). We have several options:\n\n1. **Discrete learnable radial bins**: For a kernel of finite spatial support (like \\(7\\times 7\\) or \\(11\\times 11\\)), you can discretize \\(r\\) and learn a value for each radius\u2014plus perhaps some smooth interpolation.\n2. **Polynomial expansions**: Expand \\(R_n(r)\\) in a polynomial basis (e.g., a small set of radial basis polynomials).\n3. **Bessel functions** or **Laguerre polynomials**: In more advanced settings, one may use orthogonal radial bases adapted to the Laplacian in polar coordinates (e.g., Bessel\u2013Fourier expansions).  \n\nIn practice, for small filters you often do something simple\u2014like store a few radial samples as parameters, and linearly interpolate for intermediate \\(r\\). Each harmonic order \\(n\\) will have its own radial profile.\n\nHence, a *compactly supported steerable kernel* might look like:\n\n\\[\n  \\kappa(r,\\phi)\n  = \\sum_{n = -N}^N\n      \\Bigl[\\,\n        R_n(r)\n      \\Bigr]\\,\n      e^{\\,i\\,n\\,\\phi},\n  \\quad\n  r \\le r_{\\max}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n# 4. How Steering Yields Rotation Equivariance\n\nTo see how a *layer* becomes rotation-equivariant, consider a single channel feature map \\(\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\). Convolution with a steerable kernel is:\n\n\\[\n  ( \\kappa * \\mathbf{f} )(\\mathbf{x})\n  \\;=\\;\n  \\int \\kappa(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y})\\,\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{y})\\, d\\mathbf{y}.\n\\]\n\nIf \\(\\kappa\\) is designed so that \\(\\kappa(R_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{z})) = \\kappa(\\mathbf{z})\\) steered by phase factors, then rotating \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) by \\(\\theta\\) can be passed through as a rotation of the kernel.  Concretely,\n\n\\[\n  \\mathbf{f}_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) \\;=\\; \\mathbf{f}( R_{-\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}) ),\n\\]\n(where \\(R_{\\theta}\\) denotes rotation by \\(\\theta\\)),\nand the output of convolution transforms in a consistent way.  In group-theoretic language, each kernel transforms as an *irreducible representation* of SO(2).\n\n---\n\n# 5. Constructing Small, Radially Symmetric Kernels\n\nSometimes we want simpler (partial) rotational symmetry: for instance, purely *radially* symmetric kernels (no angular dependence).  This corresponds to **\\(n=0\\) only** in the harmonic expansion:\n\n\\[\n  \\kappa(r,\\phi)\n  \\;=\\;\n  R_0(r),\n\\]\nwhich has *no* \\(\\phi\\)-dependence.  This kernel is invariant under rotation\u2014i.e., it looks the same from every angle.  Such a filter is \u201cisotropic.\u201d\n\nHowever, to get a network that can *respond to oriented patterns*, we typically need higher harmonic orders \\(\\pm n\\).  The simplest approach:\n\n1. Decide on a maximum harmonic frequency \\(N\\).\n2. For each \\(n \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,N\\}\\), learn a small radial profile (maybe 3 or 4 radial samples if the kernel is small).\n3. Construct the filter from these radial samples plus the \\(\\cos(n\\phi)\\) and \\(\\sin(n\\phi)\\) expansions.\n\nIn a discrete \\(K \\times K\\) grid (e.g., \\(K=7\\)), you can:\n1. Create a lookup table of \\((r, \\phi)\\) for each pixel offset \\((i,j)\\).\n2. Compute the basis functions (the \\(\\cos(n\\phi)\\), \\(\\sin(n\\phi)\\), plus your radial interpolation) for each pixel.\n3. Multiply by learned coefficients and sum up to get the final real-valued filter.\n\n---\n\n## Example: a 7\u00d77 Steerable Kernel with \\(N=2\\)\n\n- **Grid**: Indices \\((-3,\\dots,3)\\times(-3,\\dots,3)\\).  \n- **Polar**: For each \\((i,j)\\neq(0,0)\\), compute  \n  \\[\n    r_{i,j} = \\sqrt{i^2 + j^2}, \n    \\quad\n    \\phi_{i,j} = \\mathrm{atan2}(j,i).\n  \\]\n- **Radial bins**: Suppose you define radial knots at \\(r = \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\). You store radial values \\(\\alpha_{n,m}\\) for harmonic index \\(n\\in\\{0,1,2\\}\\) and radial bin \\(m\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\).  \n- **Interpolate**: For each pixel \\((i,j)\\), find the bin containing \\(r_{i,j}\\), linearly interpolate to get \\(R_n(r_{i,j})\\).  \n- **Combine with angular**:  \n  \\[\n    \\kappa(i,j)\n    = R_0(r_{i,j}) \n      + \\sum_{n=1}^{2} \\Bigl[\n         a_{n}(r_{i,j})\\,\\cos(n\\,\\phi_{i,j}) \n         \\;+\\;\n         b_{n}(r_{i,j})\\,\\sin(n\\,\\phi_{i,j})\n       \\Bigr].\n  \\]\n- You can either store \\(a_n(r)\\) and \\(b_n(r)\\) *directly*, or store them in the radial knots.  \n- The final \\(\\kappa(i,j)\\) is real-valued at each discrete location.\n\nSuch a kernel can be analytically rotated by \\(\\theta\\) to yield \\(\\kappa_\\theta(i,j)\\).  In a steerable CNN layer, this \u201csteering\u201d step is typically built into how feature channels transform.\n\n---\n\n# 6. Putting It All Together in a Network\n\nTo build a full rotation-equivariant network:\n\n1. **Feature Type**: Each feature map might be a stack of *steerable channels*, each channel corresponding to a certain *frequency type* \\(n\\).  Under a rotation \\(\\theta\\), a frequency-\\(n\\) channel is multiplied by \\(e^{i\\,n\\,\\theta}\\) (or in real form, the cos/sin channels mix accordingly).\n2. **Convolutional Layer**: The kernel is expanded in these harmonic basis functions.  Convolution is then performed in a way that respects these transformations.  \n3. **Nonlinearities**: Must also be carefully chosen to respect (or mix) the steerable representations.  Common solutions are \u201cmodulus nonlinearities\u201d or \u201ctensor product\u201d non-linearities that preserve group structure.\n\nModern libraries like [**e2cnn**](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/e2cnn) or others handle the details of constructing these harmonic bases, expansions, and the appropriate nonlinearities. They implement:\n\n- The \u201c\\(\\mathrm{SO}(2)\\)-steerable\u201d kernels (or discrete subgroups).\n- Automatic transforms of feature fields under rotations.\n\n---\n\n# 7. Summary of the Easiest Approach for Small Radial Kernels\n\n1. **Use a truncated harmonic expansion**:  \n   \\[\n     \\kappa(r,\\phi)\n     \\;=\\;\n     \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} R_n(r)\\, e^{\\,i\\,n\\,\\phi}.\n   \\]\n2. **Parameterize / learn \\(R_n(r)\\)**:\n   - For a small kernel (e.g. up to radius 3), store a few learnable radial samples.  \n   - Interpolate these samples to get \\(R_n(r)\\).  \n3. **Compute kernel values on each pixel** \\((i,j)\\) via \\(\\bigl(r,\\phi\\bigr)\\) lookup, multiply by the \\(\\exp(i\\,n\\,\\phi)\\) or \\(\\cos(n\\phi), \\sin(n\\phi)\\) terms, sum over \\(n\\).  \n4. **Ensure real-valuedness** by combining cosines and sines with real coefficients.  \n\nThis construction ensures that *rotating* the kernel by \\(\\theta\\) corresponds to *shifting the phase* of the harmonic terms, giving you continuous rotation *steerability*\u2014and in turn, a CNN layer that is (approximately) **rotation-equivariant** on the 2D grid.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- **Taco Cohen & Max Welling**, \u201cGroup Equivariant Convolutional Networks\u201d (ICML 2016).  \n- **Weiler et al.**, \u201cLearning Steerable Filters for Rotation Equivariant CNNs\u201d (CVPR 2018).  \n- **Weiler & Cesa**, \u201cGeneral E(2)-Equivariant Steerable CNNs\u201d (NeurIPS 2019).  \n- Libraries: [**e2cnn**](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/e2cnn), [**LieConv**](https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/LieConv).  \n\nThese explain in detail how to implement steerable kernels, how to handle multiple frequency channels, and how to ensure *complete* rotation equivariance throughout a deep network."

              "Below is a **minimal** PyTorch example showing how to build a small CNN with layers that use *radially symmetric* (isotropic) kernels so that the network is *(approximately) rotation equivariant*.  In essence, each convolution kernel depends only on the distance \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\) from the center pixel and **not** on the angle \\(\\phi\\).  By construction, such a \u201cradial\u201d kernel does not change under 2D rotations, which induces rotational *equivariance* at each layer.\n\n> **Note.** Strictly speaking, truly *steerable* (continuous) rotation-equivariant CNNs often require harmonic expansions and more advanced group theory.  But if you just want a quick-and-dirty *isotropic* filter approach (so rotating the input image leads to a rotated output feature map), defining each kernel to be *radially symmetric* is the simplest solution in \u201cfew lines\u201d of code.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Radial Kernel Initialization\n\nWe\u2019ll define a helper that returns a single-channel, 2D convolution weight \\(\\text{weight}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times 1\\times k\\times k}\\) whose values depend only on the radius from the center.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport math\n\ndef random_radial_kernel(k: int) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a (1, 1, k, k) kernel which is radially symmetric.\n    That is, weight[i,j] = f(r), where r = sqrt((i - center)^2 + (j - center)^2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Center pixel (e.g. for k=7, center = 3.0)\n    center = (k - 1) / 2.0\n    \n    # Random small coefficients for a simple radial function: f(r) = a + b*r + c*r^2\n    a, b, c = torch.randn(3) * 0.1\n    \n    # Fill the kernel with values depending only on r\n    W = torch.zeros(k, k)\n    for i in range(k):\n        for j in range(k):\n            r = math.sqrt((i - center)**2 + (j - center)**2)\n            val = a + b*r + c*(r**2)\n            W[i, j] = val\n    \n    # Make all values nonnegative (so it\u2019s easier to interpret)\n    W = torch.relu(W)\n    # If accidentally all zero, add small constant\n    if W.sum() < 1e-8:\n        W += 1e-3\n    # Normalize so sum of weights is 1 (just a choice)\n    W /= W.sum()\n    \n    # Shape (1, 1, k, k) for conv2d\n    return W.view(1, 1, k, k)\n```\n\n- We used a tiny polynomial \\(f(r) = a + b\\,r + c\\,r^2\\) with random \\(a, b, c\\).  \n- You could replace that with any \u201crandom function of \\(r\\).\u201d  \n- The key is that it depends on \\(\\phi\\) in no way, so it is *radially symmetric*.\n\n---\n\n## 2. A Single Radial-Conv Layer\n\nThis layer does:\n\n1. A single-channel \\(\\to\\) single-channel **convolution** with our radial kernel  \n2. **Add bias**  \n3. **Apply ReLU**  \n\n```python\nclass RadialConvLayer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, kernel_size=7):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.kernel_size = kernel_size\n        \n        # Initialize radially symmetric kernel\n        w = random_radial_kernel(kernel_size)\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(w)  # shape (1,1,k,k)\n        \n        # Single bias parameter\n        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # x is shape (batch_size, 1, H, W)\n        out = F.conv2d(x, self.weight, self.bias, padding=self.kernel_size//2)\n        return F.relu(out)\n```\n\n> **Note**: For multi-channel data, you can generalize this idea by creating radially symmetric kernels per (in_channel, out_channel) pair, or by using group-theoretic steerable methods.  Here we keep it minimal.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Stacking N Radial Layers\n\nFinally, let\u2019s define a simple network: \\((\\mathrm{Conv} + \\mathrm{ReLU}) \\times N\\).\n\n```python\nclass RadialCNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_layers=3, kernel_size=7):\n        super().__init__()\n        layers = []\n        for _ in range(num_layers):\n            layers.append(RadialConvLayer(kernel_size))\n        # Chain them\n        self.net = nn.Sequential(*layers)\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.net(x)\n```\n\nThat\u2019s it!  \n\n- Each layer\u2019s kernel is radially symmetric (initially randomized).  \n- Under any rotation of the input image, each radial kernel yields an output that is \u201cequivariant\u201d to that rotation (i.e., rotating input -> rotated feature map).  \n- In practice, you would typically see better results with more sophisticated (steerable) filters that allow *oriented* responses, but pure radial symmetry is the most straightforward approach in just a few lines of PyTorch.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Testing It\n\nA quick usage example:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create the model\n    model = RadialCNN(num_layers=3, kernel_size=7)\n    \n    # Fake input: batch_size=1, channels=1, H=64, W=64\n    x = torch.randn(1, 1, 64, 64)\n    \n    # Forward pass\n    y = model(x)\n    print(\"Output shape:\", y.shape)\n```\n\nYou\u2019ll get output of shape `(1, 1, 64, 64)` after the 3 radial-conv layers (with padding).  \n\n---\n\n### Why This Is (Approximately) Rotation-Equivariant\n\nBecause each 2D filter \\(\\kappa(r)\\) looks the same from every angle, if you rotate the input image by \\(\\theta\\), the *response map* of the filter also rotates by \\(\\theta\\).  Stacking multiple such layers preserves this property (aside from minor boundary/interpolation issues).\n\nHence, in \u201cvery few lines,\u201d you have a CNN that does *translation and rotation* in a (roughly) equivariant way\u2014without resorting to heavy group theory code."

But this at least shows how to build random harmonic-based filters that have rotation-equivariance properties.  \n\n---\n\n# 1) Radial-Only Kernel  \\(\\bigl(n=0\\bigr)\\)\n\nThis is exactly what we did before: the kernel depends on \\(r\\) but *not* on the angle \\(\\phi\\).\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport math\n\ndef random_radial_kernel(k: int) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a (1, 1, k, k) kernel which is radially symmetric (n=0 only).\n    That is, weight[i, j] = f(r).\n    \"\"\"\n    center = (k - 1) / 2.0\n    \n    # Random polynomial in r\n    a, b, c = torch.randn(3) * 0.1\n    W = torch.zeros(k, k)\n    for i in range(k):\n        for j in range(k):\n            r = math.sqrt((i - center)**2 + (j - center)**2)\n            val = a + b*r + c*r*r\n            W[i, j] = val\n    W = torch.relu(W)\n    if W.sum() < 1e-8:\n        W += 1e-3\n    W /= W.sum()\n    \n    return W.view(1, 1, k, k)\n```\n\n- **Pros**: Very simple, rotationally invariant if used alone.  \n- **Cons**: No ability to detect orientation (it sees the same in every direction).\n\n---\n\n# 2) Single-Frequency Harmonic Kernel (\\(n=\\pm 1\\))\n\nA slightly richer kernel uses the fundamental harmonic \\(n=1\\).  In real form, that means:\n\n\\[\n  \\kappa(r,\\phi) \n  = R_0(r) + R_1(r)\\cos(\\phi) + S_1(r)\\sin(\\phi).\n\\]\n\nWe\u2019ll randomize \\(R_0, R_1, S_1\\) each as small polynomials or radial samples.  This kernel can *detect orientation* and \u201csteer\u201d in a single direction.\n\n```python\ndef random_harmonic_kernel_1(k: int) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a (1,1,k,k) kernel with harmonic orders n=0 and n=\u00b11:\n       kappa(r,phi) = R0(r) + R1(r)*cos(phi) + S1(r)*sin(phi).\n    \"\"\"\n    center = (k - 1) / 2.0\n    \n    # Random polynomial coeffs for R0, R1, S1\n    # e.g. R0(r) = a0 + b0*r;  R1(r) = a1 + b1*r; S1(r) = a2 + b2*r\n    a0, b0 = torch.randn(2) * 0.1\n    a1, b1 = torch.randn(2) * 0.1\n    a2, b2 = torch.randn(2) * 0.1\n    \n    W = torch.zeros(k, k)\n    for i in range(k):\n        for j in range(k):\n            x = i - center\n            y = j - center\n            r = math.sqrt(x*x + y*y)\n            if abs(r) < 1e-9:\n                phi = 0.0\n            else:\n                phi = math.atan2(y, x)\n            \n            # Evaluate radial polynomials\n            R0 = a0 + b0*r\n            R1 = a1 + b1*r\n            S1 = a2 + b2*r\n            \n            val = R0 + R1*math.cos(phi) + S1*math.sin(phi)\n            W[i, j] = val\n    \n    W = torch.relu(W)\n    if W.sum() < 1e-8:\n        W += 1e-3\n    W /= W.sum()\n    \n    return W.view(1, 1, k, k)\n```\n\n- **Pros**: Now you have orientation selectivity for one harmonic frequency, so the kernel can respond differently to angles.  \n- **Cons**: Only one frequency (besides the DC/radial term) may be too limited in practice.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Multi-Frequency Harmonic Kernel (\\(n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N\\))\n\nA more general approach is to include a user-defined maximum frequency \\(N\\).  The kernel will have terms for each frequency \\(n\\) in \\([0,\\ldots, N]\\) (and \\(\\pm n\\) if we do a full complex expansion).  In real form, that amounts to:\n\n\\[\n  \\kappa(r,\\phi) \\;=\\; \n  A_0(r) \n  + \\sum_{n=1}^N \\Bigl[\\,A_n(r)\\cos(n\\phi) \\,+\\, B_n(r)\\sin(n\\phi)\\Bigr].\n\\]\n\nBelow is an example that randomly instantiates these radial functions \\(\\{A_n(r), B_n(r)\\}\\) as small polynomials:\n\n```python\ndef random_harmonic_kernel(k: int, N: int) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a (1, 1, k, k) kernel with harmonics up to n=N.\n    kappa(r,phi) = A0(r) + sum_{n=1..N}[ A_n(r)*cos(n*phi) + B_n(r)*sin(n*phi) ].\n    \"\"\"\n    center = (k - 1) / 2.0\n    \n    # For each n in 0..N, we have two radial polynomials (A_n, B_n),\n    # except for n=0, which only has A0.

Rotating the input by \\(\\theta\\) results in the feature map rotating by \\(\\theta\\).  \n   - In a proper *steerable CNN*, each frequency channel transforms in a known way (like multiplying by \\(e^{i n \\theta}\\)), preserving exact rotation-equivariance through the layers (up to boundary effects).\n\n---\n\n## Other Options\n\n- **Bessel / Laguerre bases**: Instead of polynomials in \\(r\\), you can use Bessel functions or other orthogonal bases for the radial part.  This can yield better or more stable expansions.  \n- **Discretize radial profiles**: Instead of small polynomials, you can store a table of radial samples at \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\dots\\}\\) (like 3 or 4 bins) and interpolate.  \n- **Higher-dimensional groups** (like \\(p4\\), \\(p4m\\)) for discrete rotations/reflections or full \\(\\mathrm{SO}(2)\\)-\\(\\mathrm{SO}(3)\\) for 3D data.  \n- **Libraries**: Packages such as [**e2cnn**](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/e2cnn) take care of these expansions, the required group representations, and the mixing rules for you.  \n\n---\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nIn short:\n\n- **The radial-only approach** is the simplest code snippet. It is indeed \u201ctrivial\u201d but *does* give you a form of rotation equivariance (the same response for any angle).  \n- **Harmonic expansions** let you construct truly *steerable* filters that respond differently to different angles but still transform predictably under rotation.  \n\nIf you want to *train* such filters in a deep network (with multiple frequencies), you would:\n\n1. Represent each kernel via harmonic expansions (like `random_harmonic_kernel` above) with *learnable* parameters.  \n2. Implement a forward pass that uses these expansions to produce real 2D filters.  \n3. Possibly structure each layer\u2019s *feature maps* in frequency channels so that a rotation of the input *rotates* the representation accordingly (not just in pixel space).  \n\nBut for a quick demonstration of random rotation-equivariant kernels, the code snippets above suffice to illustrate how to generate them."

              "**Steerable vs. Radially Symmetric Kernels**  \n\n1. **Radially symmetric (isotropic) filter**  \n   - A filter is called *radially symmetric* if its values depend *only* on the distance \\(r\\) from the center (and *not* on the angle \\(\\phi\\)).  \n   - Visually, it\u2019s like a circular \u201cblob.\u201d If you rotate that blob around its center, it *doesn\u2019t change* at all.  \n   - **Consequence**: It sees the image the same way in every direction, so it cannot distinguish whether a feature (like an edge) is oriented at 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, or 90\u00b0.  \n\n2. **Steerable filter**  \n   - A filter is *steerable* if you can rotate it to any angle *analytically* by applying a simple transformation to its parameters.  \n   - In mathematical terms (for 2D), we often write a filter \\(\\kappa(r,\\phi)\\) in a harmonic expansion. Rotating the filter by an angle \\(\\theta\\) corresponds to \u201cshifting the phase\u201d of each harmonic term by \\(n\\theta\\). This is a *simple* operation in the parameter space (multiplying by \\(e^{i\\,n\\,\\theta}\\) in the complex form, or shifting cos/sin phases in the real form).  \n   - **Consequence**: The filter can be *oriented* in different ways to detect edges/lines/textures at various angles.  \n\n---\n\n### Why \u201csteerable\u201d instead of just \u201cradially symmetric\u201d?  \n\n- **Radially symmetric = orientation-agnostic**.  \n  - If your kernel is just a circular blob, it *cannot* \u201cknow\u201d whether something is oriented horizontally or vertically. It\u2019s the same response for *all* directions.  \n  - In image processing terms, a purely radial filter is *rotation-invariant*\u2014it sees no difference among rotated versions of the same pattern.  \n\n- **Steerable = orientation-sensitive**.  \n  - Steerable kernels can respond *differently* depending on the feature\u2019s orientation.  \n  - For example, a filter might respond strongly to a vertical edge but weakly to a horizontal edge. If you \u201csteer\u201d that filter by 90\u00b0, it then responds strongly to the horizontal edge.  \n  - Mathematically, you can rotate the filter in a predictable, linear way\u2014handy for detecting or extracting orientation-specific features.  \n\n---\n\n### What does \u201cresponding to oriented features\u201d mean?  \n- **Edges, lines, textures** in images often have a specific *direction* (angle).  \n- A steerable filter (like a Gabor filter, or a harmonic-based kernel) might produce a *strong* output for edges aligned with its orientation, and a *weak* output for edges misaligned.  \n- By contrast, a radial filter sees *no difference* if you rotate the edge\u2014its response is the same in all directions.  \n\nHence, **steerable filters** are more expressive when dealing with directional patterns:  \n1. You can detect edges at multiple angles.  \n2. You can \u201csteer\u201d (rotate) your filter to match the angle of the feature you\u2019re looking for.  \n3. If the input rotates by \\(\\theta\\), the feature map rotates accordingly (this is the *equivariance* part).  \n\nThat extra orientation sensitivity is usually the main reason to prefer steerable kernels over trivial radial ones."

              "The **IndexError** happens because in the code snippet we did not allocate enough parameters (`real_params`) to cover all of the frequency components \\(\\{n=0,1,\\dots,N\\}\\).

But we want the *same* parameters for *all* pixels. Therefore, after each pixel we must reset `idx = 2`, so that the next pixel\u2019s evaluation re-reads the same radial/harmonic parameters from the start (beyond the \\(n=0\\) ones).\n\n   Alternatively, we can re-structure the code to loop over \\(n\\) *outside* the (i,j) loops, computing \\(\\cos(n\\phi)\\) and \\(\\sin(n\\phi)\\) for each pixel, but that\u2019s a bigger rewrite. This small fix ensures the code runs without the indexing error.\n\nWith these fixes, calling:\n\n```python\nrandom_harmonic_kernel(5, 2)\n```\n\nwill now return a \\((1,1,5,5)\\) kernel expanded from random harmonic parameters (frequencies \\(n=0,1,2\\)), without the IndexError."
