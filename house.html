            <p>This house is built on the principle of creating new knowledge; <i>inventing</i>.</p>
            
            <p>We believe invention comes in many forms, but regardless of what you do it must be shared. Sharing your work ‚Äî both privately and publicly ‚Äî is the ultimate defense against delusion and a compass towards truth. Sharing knowledge exposes you to new and potentially better explanations, so to avoid sharing is to fear the truth.</p>
            
            <p>Knowledge that is never shared is a tragedy, but it must also be done with care. Over-simplification and over-complication are almost as bad as not sharing.</p>
            
            <p>Therefore the objective is to maximize that quantity of new knowledge created, subject to the constraint that it is shared with the world in its most honest representation.</p>
            
            <p>Living here is a commitment to sharing the knowledge you create. That means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Publishing papers</li>
                    <li>Open-sourcing hardware and/or software</li>
                    <li>Gathering and releasing valuable data</li>
                </ul>

                The Residency was founded with the mission of creating an alternative to college where you can learn by doing instead of rotting in a lecture hall. Since its inception in 2022, the Residency has grown to a diverse network of 10+ hacker houses across 6 countries. Hundreds of young founders have called the Residency home and now we're ready to expand to a new demographic: researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                (House name) is our first step in this direction. With it, we are laying the foundation for a new institution built on meritocracy not bureaucracy. We're bringing together talented inventors to seed the kind of innovative and truth-seeking culture that millions of college students have missed out on. We want the world to see that the only barrier to novel breakthroughs is a mindset, and that this mindset is contagious.
            </p>
            <p>
                We've seen this innovation mindset repeatedly emerge across the Residency's network of houses when the right people were brought together. Values like curiosity, openness, optimism and agency became unspoken rules, collectively enforced through the daily exchange of ideas. It's a really special feeling when it happens, so we try hard to recreate these conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a founding resident, you'll get to help shape this culture with your own flavor of invention and impart some of your ambition onto the next generation of inventors. One year from now, we hope to run a collection of themed houses in close proximity to each other, all pushing frontiers in their respective domains. You'll have the opportunity to build a team around your research and scale up to a full-fledged lab if you so desire.
